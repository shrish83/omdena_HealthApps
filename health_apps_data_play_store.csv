Problems with your partner that leave you needing <b>mental support</b>?

Is your work inducing <b>stress</b> and <b>anxiety,</b> making each day harder to get through?

Are you tired of <b>mental health apps</b> that focus only on <b>meditation?</b>

If you seek <b>mental relief</b> and <b>better help</b> for <b>mental health</b> that goes beyond <b>mindfulness</b>...

You're in the right place.

Hi there, Welcome to being 👋

A unique <b>self-therapy app</b> (read: buddy) that <b>care</b>s.

Your <b>mental health friend</b> and <b>self-care guide</b>.

<b>meditation</b> and <b>mindfulness alone</b> can't <b>support mental well-being</b>.

Why? Because mental health means feelings, countless feelings that we experience every single day. 

And <b>being</b> has something for <b>all</b> of them. 

A <b>therapy app</b> that goes beyond traditional <b>mindfulness practices</b> to address what you're feeling in the moment.

Be it <b>stress</b>, <b>depression</b>, <b>anxiety relief</b>, <b>productivity</b>, loneliness, or any mental and emotional struggle you are battling,

being seeks to understand you, to help you GROW through what you GO through.

HOW?

<b>being</b> offers you small, easy, and simple steps for <b>self-improvement.</b>

When you're lonely, upset, anxious, or depressed,

When you can't <b>sleep</b> or question your existence,

Even when you don't know what you are feeling…

<b>Try A Mini-Therapy 💖</b>

A mini-<b>therapy</b> is a bite-sized <b>therapy</b> session.

<b>Professionally created</b>, short, interactive, and hyper-personalized

For all your emotions… known or unknown.

The best part? Start feeling better in under 10 minutes. 🤗

When you need <b>mental relief</b> or <b>therapy</b>, give <b>Mini-therapy</b> a try.

<b>Form Mini-Habits 🌻</b>

Mini-habits help you practice self-acceptance and <b>self-care</b> through small steps,

And support <b>anxiety release</b> by helping you be in the moment :)

Let <b>Music Therapy 🎵</b> help you <b>find mental love</b>.

Anytime is a good time for <b>self-care,</b> whatever the mood.

And being has a playlist for <b>every</b> mood, emotion, and activity.

Even a few minutes of being's <b>Music Therapy</b> enables <b>anxiety relief.</b> ✨

Some <b>mental health apps</b> deliver <b>meditation</b> or mindfulness advice.

And some people may shame you for talking about your emotions (or ask you to “go take a walk”)

But not <b>being</b>.

<b>being</b> recognizes that <b>mental health</b> is a continuous and lifelong journey.

And when it comes to <b>coping</b> with <b>anxiety and depression,</b>

Every day is different. Some days are more challenging than others…

No matter what, <b>being</b> will be your <b>mental health friend</b> on all kinds of days, even the hardest ones.

With:

✔ Science-backed tools like <b>CBT</b> & <b>DMT</b>

✔ Calming & Focus Music

✔ Journal prompts 

✔ Affirmations 

✔ and much more!

You see, <b>self-help</b> is the most important kind of help for <b>personal well-being</b>.

But what if you also had a bit of guidance and a whole lot of <b>care</b> and love to go along? Enter <b>being.</b>

We can't promise that there won't be tough times;

But even on days when you can't see a single ray of light,

<b>being</b>'s got your back.

Your <b>mental health</b> is safe with <b>being</b>! Promise!

Now take a few minutes to relax and just be :)

Without leaving the comfort of your home, you can have:

Getting started is easy, and many members can have their first visit within 20 minutes of signing up! 

Here’s how it works:
1. Tell us a bit about your symptoms by answering a few short questions.
2. Select a plan that suits your needs. Membership plans include prescription services, therapy, or a combination of both.
3. Get on a video/phone call with one of our prescribing mental health providers.

Cerebral can have positive impacts on your mental health and well-being, just like it has for so many of our patients. Here’s what a few of them are saying:

“My therapist suggested I consider antidepressants months ago, but the cost to see a psychiatrist was too high. So I just didn’t try antidepressants at all for awhile. Since my therapist referred me to Cerebral, I get to talk not only to my prescribing doctor but also to a care counselor who makes herself available to answer all of my questions.” - Alex M

“What an easy way to access really awesome care. Cerebral makes it easy - and my doctor and care counselor really care about me. When I first signed up, I thought it would be all about medication, but my Care Counselor Steven has shown me techniques like deep breathing exercises that really calm me down when I’m having a hard time.” - Diana L

Meet Breeze — a mood tracker that is here to become your faithful ally in strengthening your mental health. Feelings to track, detailed stats to check, tests to do, and courses to learn — let us provide you with the features that will help you grow! 

Breeze doesn’t aim to replace a therapist. The mission is to help you improve your self-assessment and raise your awareness about depression, anxiety, bipolar disorder, extreme mood swings, and other mental disorders. The app is based on several concepts from cognitive-behavioral psychotherapy and contains four main features described below.

Mood tracker

Journal your mood daily to better understand the nature of your feelings and learn to be more in control of your emotions. Create a map of your emotional conditions and be aware of people and activities that make you happy or bring you down.

Negative thoughts tracker

The concept of automatic negative thoughts comes from cognitive behavioral therapy. The idea is that even minor negative thoughts that automatically appear in our consciousness influence our mood and psychological conditions.
We provide you with several interactive techniques that help recognize and fight such negative patterns in thinking.

Tracker of cognitive distortions

Is it depression that makes you feel low? How to cope with panic attacks and anxiety? How to take care of people with bipolar disorder? We give some useful insights into popular cognitive distortions and teach you how to identify flaws in your thinking and behavior.
Tests and self-assessments to discover your inner self

The concept of psychological testing helps a lot to understand certain behaviors. We offer a great variety of tests: the Beck Anxiety Inventory Test, Beck Depression Inventory Test, Personality test, Mood Disorder Test, Test on Positive outlook, and many more. 
Advice from a psychotherapist (in future updates)
Some practical advice from an acknowledged psychotherapist — he will cover widespread topics and issues people usually have in different areas of life.

General mental health,CBT Thought Diary,https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/SZJvxFP4TzJytlenSEbCOtm-8FSxHy9KQ3-fkQ1tBSZekzpnWfrQDuFTBxTc-AhUfzYN,"* THE BEST JOURNAL APP TO IMPROVE YOUR MOOD *

CBT Thought Diary is a journal with a purpose: it uses effective tools from Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT), Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT), Dialectical Behavioral Therapy (DBT), and Positive Psychology to help improve your mood.

Do you feel like you're always stressed, anxious, sad, frustrated, or unmotivated? The centerpiece of cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) is learning to identify negative and distorted thinking patterns to change your emotions and your behaviors for the better. In CBT, a ""thought record"" guides you through the steps of identifying, challenging, and reinterpreting negative thinking patterns. With Thought Diary, you can document your negative emotions, analyze flaws in your thinking, and re-evaluate your negative thoughts into more balanced ones. It may even help you recognize helpful ways to deal with your negative behaviors and emotions for future situations.

CBT Thought Diary can do more than thought records, though! It can also be used as a daily mood tracker. You can even practice gratitude by creating positive entries using our flexible diary entry format. According to positive psychology, appreciating the positives in our lives can improve happiness and meaning.
 
With CBT Thought Diary, you can gradually change your approach to how you interpret the ups and downs of life, making long-lasting changes in your mental well-being.

According to positive psychology, practicing gratitude and recording positive emotions is important as well. Thought Diary also allows you to keep track of your positive experiences so that you can refer back to them and appreciate the good moments, as well as note down what particular things you're grateful for. This way, you can be more aware and thankful of the positive moments in life.

Thought Diary will help you evaluate, understand, and change your thoughts and feelings. By using this application, you can work to identify your emotions, analyze how and why you're feeling this way, challenge those negative beliefs, change your thinking patterns for future situations, and remember positive experiences. You can use this app as a mood journal, a thought record journal, and a gratitude journal.

Thought Records and Gratitude Journals similar to this app are commonly used in paper form in traditional cognitive-behavioral therapy for a variety of mental health disorders such as clinical depression and anxiety. If you are suffering from a mental health disorder, please consult a mental health professional or healthcare provider.

Unlike meditation, it's fun, easy, and brings fast results. Try it out, and see the effects in as little as 8 minutes!

<b>VOICE WILL HELP YOU</b>

- Your past experiences don't matter. Even if you're brand new to this, you'll still see progress in just 8 minutes.

- You don't need to focus hard on your breathing or be in a certain pose. All you need is to sit down, close your eyes, plug in your earphones, and start listening. We'll take care of the rest.


<b>HYPNOTELLING: OUR SECRET WEAPON</b>

We like to believe we make all our decisions rationally, but that's not exactly true. Most of the time, we're driven by emotions we don't fully understand or can't entirely control.

Luckily, your subconscious mind can give you all the things you need. You just need to speak its language - images, sensations etc.

Your subconscious mind is like a monkey: it doesn't understand words, but it understands visual information, and remembers emotions. Once you understand this, you can tune it to your liking. Voice allows you to connect to your subconscious mind. It teaches, it heals, it helps to calm down and regain your strength.

For example, it won't only help you deal with anxiety, sleep problems, or burnout, but will also help get to the root of your problems and the reason behind their symptoms, so you can feel calm, inspired, and motivated again.
You become the main character of an exciting adventure story. It's sort of like embarking on a psychological quest in a dreamlike state. You move through a story, face challenges along the way, and learn how to tackle them.

Unlike meditation, our stories help keep your brain alert and conscious. It enters a trance-like state where it absorbs information more effectively, giving you faster results. The closest thing it can be compared to is affirmations. You'll notice relaxation and motivation as quick as 8 minutes story.


<b>BASED ON RESEARCH-BACKED TECHNIQUES</b>

Hypnotelling is based on a method that has been used for athlete training, supportive therapy, psychotherapy, and for scientific research.


<b>HYPNOTELLING EFFECTIVELY HELPS</b>

- lower anxiety and stress levels
- get you to sleep faster without meditation, and improve your sleeping habits
- boost your energy
- increase self-motivation
- improve mental health

Meditation help you develop mindfulness, but it's a slow and difficult process that can be hard to navigate on your own. Voice is like meditation 2.0: it not only allows you to expand your consciousness, but also helps you apply this experience and take action today, tomorrow, and forever. And the best thing is, you'll acquire beneficial mental skills that will stay with you for the rest of your life!

You can be sad, happy, excited, or depressed, it doesn't matter. The thing that matters is how you interact with these emotions because even when you are happy you need to be able to let go of this happiness and not try to prolong it artificially because there will be consequences. Meditation is a perfect solution to this. It will help you to relax and calm down. Freeing yourself from emotions and thoughts is an important skill that we need to master. Also, a good tool for this is simple sleep because sleep is like a small natural meditation that will lift some stress and let you rest. After sleep you are renewed, everything seems less scary and more possible. There is one more common thing in these two states. The thing is that they are not so easy to attain. Meditation asks from you concentration, proper breathing techniques, and a clear mind at the same time. Sleep is supposed to have good quality and be healthy. Sounds hard, isn’t it? But we can and we want to help you with that. Our app was created specifically for these purposes, to help people how to meditate and improve their sleep.
How do we help you achieve improvements in your sleep and how will our app teach you meditation?
Akamu free app has a library of different sounds, music, articles, the practice of mindfulness, and lectures. Let’s look closer at them. They can be used separately for something specific. For example, music and sounds are there to help you fall asleep, concentrate, practice your meditation skills and relax. But we would recommend you combine them. After a lecture about how to start to meditate, you can immediately jump to proper composition, the sound of nature, or mantra and begin practice. That way you will gain as much profit as possible. While you are heading somewhere by taxi or by bus you can turn on music for concentration and read articles that we gathered. This will allow us to absorb and understand information better. Akamu is a versatile free app that helps you not only with things we mentioned before, but while you practice them passively you will become more relaxed, and more open-minded, but you will also begin to understand yourself better, and it will be easier for you to go through stressful situations, anxiety will slowly disappear from your life. Our goal is not just to teach you how to meditate or improve your sleep, we want to give you the possibility to have a spiritual journey whenever you need/want to.
So, let’s sum up what our app has:
Courses and lectures that will teach you meditation and not only
Practices of mindfulness so you would understand yourself better
Sounds of nature and music for different purposes like concentrating or meditating
Sleep practices to improve its quality
Spiritual improvement, calmness, and relaxation are things that will come after you use our app for some period of time
Akamu is a place where you can improve spiritually. Essential knowledge of how to become better in form that is easy to understand even for somebody who is new at this. Akamu free app is your pocket guide in your spiritual journey.","100,000+",3.875,Health & Fitness,USD,0.0,True

Don’t think of Waking Up as a conventional meditation app—think of it as a new operating system for your mind, and a guide to living a better life.
 
We aim to offer a far deeper approach to mindfulness than you’ll find elsewhere—one that fundamentally transforms how you see yourself, and the world around you.
 
But you’ll also discover life-changing, secular wisdom from top scholars and experts, on everything from sleep and doing good in the world to time management and happiness.
 
Waking Up is free for anyone who can’t afford it. We never want money to be the reason why someone can’t benefit from what we’ve built. 
 
**Created by Sam Harris
Sam Harris, neuroscientist and best-selling author, built Waking Up to be the resource he wished he’d had when he began exploring meditation over 30 years ago.
 
Sam only includes those practices and insights he’s found to be utterly life-changing. The same is true for the many teachers, scholars, and experts you’ll meet throughout the app.
 
**A step-by-step approach to mindfulness
We’ve heard from thousands of members who say they never really understood meditation until they took our 28-part Introductory Course. 
 
Whether you’re a beginner or advanced practitioner, you’ll dive straight into the deep end of real mindfulness, so you don’t waste any time on the surface.
 
**Learn the true purpose of meditation
Meditation is about more than just relieving stress, sleeping better, or improving your focus. While it can help you do all of that, our goal is ultimately to help you open the door to a deeper understanding of yourself.
 
Here, you won’t just uncover simple relaxation techniques —and you won’t find any New Age fluff or religious dogma. 
 
**A place for serious seekers
Explore some of life’s most important questions, on topics like neuroscience, psychedelics, enlightenment, ethics, and Stoicism—from renowned authors and professors like Oliver Burkeman, Michael Pollan, Laurie Santos, Arthur C. Brooks, James Clear, and others.
 
**In-depth theory and practice
Waking Up explains both the theory and the practice of meditation —so you don’t just learn the “how” of mindfulness, but also the “why.” 
 
You’ll be guided by prominent figures like Joseph Goldstein, Diana Winston, Adyashanti, Jayasāra, and Henry Shukman, who teach a wide range of contemplative practices, including Vipassana, Zen, Dzogchen, Advaita Vedanta, and more.
 
**Timeless insights, modern lens
Within Waking Up, you’ll find some of the most profound spiritual teachings from throughout history—those that have stood the test of time. And you’ll hear from historic voices like Alan Watts.
 
But we also pressure-test ancient wisdom against modern science, so you won’t find outlandish claims or anything we haven’t found to be empirically true.
 
**A comprehensive guide
Waking Up supports your growth and development in a number of different ways. You’ll find an abundance of useful features, like meditation timers, in-app support messages, an ever-growing audio library, and daily reminders to help bring your mindfulness practice into your life.
 
“Waking Up is, hands down, the most important meditation guide I’ve ever used.” Physician Peter Attia
 
“If you’ve had trouble getting into meditation, this app is your answer!” -Susan Cain, best-selling author

👩I am Sara Bern, holding a M.Sc. in Computer Science and Engineering.

EFT, Emotional Freedom Technique made me really suspicious. Could it really work, and so quickly? 
But when EFT helped me get rid of my frustration as well as my food intolerance and later did the same for my three kids, I converted into a dedicated EFT user and took every course I could find.  

GO EFT Tapping is for you if you want to get relief from: 
   • worry
   • anger
   • fear
   • grief
   • sadness
   • anxiety
   • stress of the day 
   • frustration over e.g. certain people or physical ailments 🤮 

Research shows that EFT reduces stress hormones (cortisol) remarkably fast and efficient.

You may see the huge benefits of removing limiting beliefs that are blocking you from well-deserved progress. GO EFT Tapping is a perfect tool to get rid of limiting beliefs.

Let EFT (Emotional Freedom Technique) become a habit and you will end up with a powerful tool, always on and literally at your fingertips. 🖐️

Try it on anything, as Nick and Jessica Ortner use to say. 
Allow yourself to be curious and persistent!

Try it on your physical problems, too. It might work, and it won’t hurt.

Use this GO EFT Tapping application, until you know the points and the process by heart. 💗

Show it to your friends, family and colleagues. 📤 It might be the best tip you’ll ever give them.

By your rating of the application, positive remarks and improvement proposals you help prioritize changes in the next upgrade.

The Arabic version is made possible by Dr. Ashraf Al-Hadethe MBPsS, PhD Clinical Psychology and currently Head of Test Department at the Baghdad University. His PhD Thesis was made at Clinical Psychology, Division of Psychiatry and Applied Psychology, School of Medicine at The University of Nottingham, United Kingdom. The thesis compared EFT tapping to other psychological interventions for stress and trauma. Dr. Al-Hadethe wanted to spread the EFT tapping across the Arabic speaking world, where professional psychological support often is a scarce or very expensive resource. This GO EFT Tapping app makes it easy to tap on your own.

What if healing is allowed to be easy? What if it can feel more like play?

Tapping with T is both a community of self healers and a playground of tools intended to support you in rewiring your brain and is ultimately here to assist you in healing yourself.

With a weekly-updated library of EFT (Emotional Freedom Technique) tapping videos, breathwork, Non-Sleep Deep Rest, and guided relaxations, Tapping with T supports you to regulate at your own pace. We host group calls every 5-6 weeks to integrate and deepen your self-paced healing practice as we question & shake off old stories collectively.

The community forum is a space to ask questions, make video requests, share reflections, get updates, and ultimately to serve as a reminder that we get to heal and grow together. We were never meant to do this alone and we don't have to. Together, we learn to release what is weighing us down, step into new possibilities, and widen our windows of tolerance with tenderness!

Videos range in length from 5-25 minutes. We cover a wide range of topics including:

~Handling anxiety: about being chronically ill, having food reactions & flare-ups, panic attacks, social events, not being able to sleep, etc.

~Honoring depression: using parts work to see low energy states as opportunities to lean in, learning to move through & release emotions with curiosity.

~Confidence & Body-image: for unwanted weight-gain, unwanted weight-loss, acne, body-acceptance, binge-eating, people-pleasing, and releasing the worry about what people might think.

~Sleep support: for those with insomnia or panic, night sweats, waking up exhausted, brain fog, healing while you sleep, etc.

~Energy support: for chronic fatigue, PMS, fibromyalgia, MCAS, exercise, burn-out, etc.

~Releasing fear: around never getting better, feeling behind, feeling disabled by symptoms, not knowing the next step to take to heal, and more.

~Chronic symptom support: for Lyme & infections, mold, gut disorders, pain, PTSD, food sensitivities, fatigue, sadness, etc.

~Relationship support: for boundaries, communication, finding love, connection.

~Releasing trapped emotions: for healing physical symptoms related to anger, grudges, grief, etc.

~Pregnancy & Postpartum: TTC, depression & fatigue, & traumatic birth experiences.

~Our videos target those with complex cases of chronic illness & trauma wanting to feel grounded, hopeful, and healthy again.

With each tap, we step out of limbic loops, lower stress, and allow the body to heal & favor continual growth.

EFT tapping,CBT Thought Diary,https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/SZJvxFP4TzJytlenSEbCOtm-8FSxHy9KQ3-fkQ1tBSZekzpnWfrQDuFTBxTc-AhUfzYN,"* THE BEST JOURNAL APP TO IMPROVE YOUR MOOD *

CBT Thought Diary is a journal with a purpose: it uses effective tools from Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT), Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT), Dialectical Behavioral Therapy (DBT), and Positive Psychology to help improve your mood.

Do you feel like you're always stressed, anxious, sad, frustrated, or unmotivated? The centerpiece of cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) is learning to identify negative and distorted thinking patterns to change your emotions and your behaviors for the better. In CBT, a ""thought record"" guides you through the steps of identifying, challenging, and reinterpreting negative thinking patterns. With Thought Diary, you can document your negative emotions, analyze flaws in your thinking, and re-evaluate your negative thoughts into more balanced ones. It may even help you recognize helpful ways to deal with your negative behaviors and emotions for future situations.

CBT Thought Diary can do more than thought records, though! It can also be used as a daily mood tracker. You can even practice gratitude by creating positive entries using our flexible diary entry format. According to positive psychology, appreciating the positives in our lives can improve happiness and meaning.
 
With CBT Thought Diary, you can gradually change your approach to how you interpret the ups and downs of life, making long-lasting changes in your mental well-being.

According to positive psychology, practicing gratitude and recording positive emotions is important as well. Thought Diary also allows you to keep track of your positive experiences so that you can refer back to them and appreciate the good moments, as well as note down what particular things you're grateful for. This way, you can be more aware and thankful of the positive moments in life.

Thought Diary will help you evaluate, understand, and change your thoughts and feelings. By using this application, you can work to identify your emotions, analyze how and why you're feeling this way, challenge those negative beliefs, change your thinking patterns for future situations, and remember positive experiences. You can use this app as a mood journal, a thought record journal, and a gratitude journal.

Thought Records and Gratitude Journals similar to this app are commonly used in paper form in traditional cognitive-behavioral therapy for a variety of mental health disorders such as clinical depression and anxiety. If you are suffering from a mental health disorder, please consult a mental health professional or healthcare provider.

Problems with your partner that leave you needing <b>mental support</b>?

Is your work inducing <b>stress</b> and <b>anxiety,</b> making each day harder to get through?

Are you tired of <b>mental health apps</b> that focus only on <b>meditation?</b>

If you seek <b>mental relief</b> and <b>better help</b> for <b>mental health</b> that goes beyond <b>mindfulness</b>...

You're in the right place.

Hi there, Welcome to being 👋

A unique <b>self-therapy app</b> (read: buddy) that <b>care</b>s.

Your <b>mental health friend</b> and <b>self-care guide</b>.

<b>meditation</b> and <b>mindfulness alone</b> can't <b>support mental well-being</b>.

Why? Because mental health means feelings, countless feelings that we experience every single day. 

And <b>being</b> has something for <b>all</b> of them. 

A <b>therapy app</b> that goes beyond traditional <b>mindfulness practices</b> to address what you're feeling in the moment.

Be it <b>stress</b>, <b>depression</b>, <b>anxiety relief</b>, <b>productivity</b>, loneliness, or any mental and emotional struggle you are battling,

being seeks to understand you, to help you GROW through what you GO through.

HOW?

<b>being</b> offers you small, easy, and simple steps for <b>self-improvement.</b>

When you're lonely, upset, anxious, or depressed,

When you can't <b>sleep</b> or question your existence,

Even when you don't know what you are feeling…

<b>Try A Mini-Therapy 💖</b>

A mini-<b>therapy</b> is a bite-sized <b>therapy</b> session.

<b>Professionally created</b>, short, interactive, and hyper-personalized

For all your emotions… known or unknown.

The best part? Start feeling better in under 10 minutes. 🤗

When you need <b>mental relief</b> or <b>therapy</b>, give <b>Mini-therapy</b> a try.

<b>Form Mini-Habits 🌻</b>

Mini-habits help you practice self-acceptance and <b>self-care</b> through small steps,

And support <b>anxiety release</b> by helping you be in the moment :)

Let <b>Music Therapy 🎵</b> help you <b>find mental love</b>.

Anytime is a good time for <b>self-care,</b> whatever the mood.

And being has a playlist for <b>every</b> mood, emotion, and activity.

Even a few minutes of being's <b>Music Therapy</b> enables <b>anxiety relief.</b> ✨

Some <b>mental health apps</b> deliver <b>meditation</b> or mindfulness advice.

And some people may shame you for talking about your emotions (or ask you to “go take a walk”)

But not <b>being</b>.

<b>being</b> recognizes that <b>mental health</b> is a continuous and lifelong journey.

And when it comes to <b>coping</b> with <b>anxiety and depression,</b>

Every day is different. Some days are more challenging than others…

No matter what, <b>being</b> will be your <b>mental health friend</b> on all kinds of days, even the hardest ones.

With:

✔ Science-backed tools like <b>CBT</b> & <b>DMT</b>

✔ Calming & Focus Music

✔ Journal prompts 

✔ Affirmations 

✔ and much more!

You see, <b>self-help</b> is the most important kind of help for <b>personal well-being</b>.

But what if you also had a bit of guidance and a whole lot of <b>care</b> and love to go along? Enter <b>being.</b>

We can't promise that there won't be tough times;

But even on days when you can't see a single ray of light,

<b>being</b>'s got your back.

Your <b>mental health</b> is safe with <b>being</b>! Promise!

Now take a few minutes to relax and just be :)

Stress impact.
Under the influence of stress, we often lose control of ourselves and the situations we are dealing with. 25% of people in the world will be affected by mental or neurological disorders at some point in their lives. 40% of countries have no public mental health policies.

Norbu: Meditation Breathe Yoga app trains your stress-management skills.
🎓   It had been scientifically proven that stress negatively affects the immune system.  Norbu proposes Mindfulness Based Stress Control (MBSC) technique. This method helps handle stress and strengthen immunity in a short and effective way and develop the skill of active stress management. The training methodology has been compiled and based on research in the PubMed scientific base.


The Gratitude Timer.

❗️ Evolutionarily, humans are better at remembering life-threatening negative events in order to avoid them in the future.
Pleasant events do not affect survival and therefore are not as well remembered.

🤯 Because of this evolutionary mechanism, humans may have the impression that life consists mostly of negative events. 

😎 However, this can be corrected. Just start writing down all the good events during the day to see that life provides a lot of positive emotions.

🥰 The Gratitude Timer will help you look at your life in a new way.
Every time you hear the timer, think of any pleasant event. It could be a delicious morning coffee, you got a good night's sleep, or you met a friend.
Write down and thank yourself for that event.

Instant meditation is needed to bring you back to reality. To begin, set the Timer and answer these questions each time you hear the sound of a gong:
Awareness of place.
- Where are you now? Look at the walls, the furniture, look out the window. What's the weather like? What am I sitting on?
Awareness of body needs.
- Do I want to eat now? Do I want to move and stretch? Am I tired and I want to rest?
Awareness of thoughts.
- Am I now thinking about what I had originally planned?

This way of coming back to reality seems artificial at first, but over time you learn to better listen to your real needs and notice them at the right time. This will help you develop mindfulness, better sleep and happiness!

🎁  Anxiety relief games, abdominal breathing exercises and guided meditations help to develop stress-control habits. “5-days unlock Premium for free” feature makes these premium exercises available for those who really need them for free.

It's a right choice for anyone who's aware of the importance of mental self-care or is searching for a perfect state of mind and better physical condition.

🔥  Norbu app has guided meditations and antistress trainings. The exercises are very simple and safe. You can meditate and use the parasympathetic breathing with a guide or in silence.

Digital wellbeing
Self-development is the purpose of the antistress Challenge. During the course of a month, you'll learn to manage stress more effectively. Play calming games, breathe and meditate - each day for 8-10 minutes. After just a few days you'll start to better understand and manage your emotions. So, you'll feel more confident and calm in stressful situations.

We want to be surrounded by mindful and relaxed people without the stress and this is our goal!

Stress management,"MoodSpace - Stress, anxiety, &",https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/xbJ-gFgpmcgfefI0tlmWpyGnAkDT1dzLoaip5ZckHmia01PPydu4mu0JLdcXNhpPozw,"<b>Imagine something…</b>
You're not feeling your best. You might call it stress, anxiety, depression, low mood, or something completely different. What you do know is that you want to do something about it.

So where do you begin?

<b>Enter the world of MoodSpace</b>
MoodSpace brings together techniques from cognitive behavioural therapy, mindfulness based cognitive therapy, positive psychology, and behavioural activation into a self-help space for mental wellbeing to guide you in managing and improving your mental health.
Techniques such as recognising three good things in a gratitude journal and balancing automatic thoughts in the cbt thought record are grounded in decades of research on what makes us happy.

<i>Three Clouds</i> 
Notice life's good moments by writing a delightful three good things in a gratitude journal and note the good things that are all too often forgotten.

Three Clouds is based on the gratitude journal from Positive Psychotherapy. By writing three good things each day the aim is to reduce worry, improve self-esteem, help cope with stress, and more.

<i>Thought Diary</i> 
Look at stressful situations in a healthy, balanced way. Prevent rumination by using the thought record to challenge automatic thinking and gain a new understanding of stressful situations.

The thought dairy (or thought record) is a tool used in CBT to reframe thinking. By analysing thinking patterns in the cbt thought record it helps you to recognise and balance unhelpful thought patterns.

<i>Guided Meditation</i>
Focus on your breath, re-focus, and become more mindful by learning to meditate. Take your first steps into mindfulness by listening to a selection of guided meditations. Or use the custom meditation timer with a selection of calming nature sounds. Cultivating this sense of mindfulness can help prevent rumination and help cope with stress. 

<i>Day Planner</i>
Schedule your time in this activity planner based on what brings you fulfilment. Rediscover what brings you happiness and make the plans that bring those things back into your life. Ensure your life has balance by making plans around work, fun, and rest to help reduce stress.

<b>At your fingertips</b>
MoodSpace techniques are designed to be as simple as possible to use.

The three good things technique can be used daily to keep track of the little things. And this gratitude journal can be looked back on in the future whenever you're in need of a smile.

The thought diary cbt is good to use at a moments notice when a stressful situation occurs. To quickly cope with stress and get back on with your day.

<b>A wellbeing app driven by the research</b>

If you suffer from anxiety or depression, you are far from being alone: It has been estimated that today, there are over 260 million people around the world dealing with depression and 280 million dealing with anxiety. 

MoodSpace takes its techniques from decades of research on what helps in dealing with anxiety and dealing with depression, and brings those techniques to your fingertips.

The app aims to create a self-help space where you will have the opportunity to experiment with techniques backed by research to see what works for you. 

Using this knowledge, we encourage you to carry out your own, further research into your favourite techniques. Your continued learning can build the coping strategies which enable you to cope with stress and manage low mood

The information to bring you happiness is out there but therapy is all too often prohibitively expensive or inaccessible. We think everyone should have access to these tools. 

You will never be alone, and we hope this app will provide the self-help tools which guide you to a happier life.

----------

MoodSpace isn't a replacement for therapy or treatment – it's simply an introduction to mental wellbeing techniques and provides a self-help space to learn about yourself.

We always recommend you speak to your doctor to access the treatment available to you.","100,000+",3.86,Medical,USD,0.0,True

- What is the principle behind StressScan? − 
Many of the functions essential to maintaining human health are controlled by the autonomic nervous system. It is medically recognized that the balance of the autonomic nervous system can become disordered through fatigue and other stress, stemming from causes such as work and human relationships. By analyzing the waveform of your heartbeat as measured at the fingertip, StressScan can analyze the balance of your autonomic nervous system and measure your stress level on a stress index of 1 to 100.

- You can trust Stress Scan! - 
The technology used by Stress Scan is based on heart rate variability analysis, which is widely recognized in the field of heart rate analysis and autonomic nervous system research. 
Although heart rate variability analysis technology is not yet generally well known, many medical institutions and companies have taken an interest and are beginning to put it to use. The technology is seeing use even at the cutting edge of stress care, including adoption by the US military to treat post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) in soldiers returning from the battlefield, and by NASA for astronaut training and health management.

- Usable in a range of scenarios! - 
· Periodic checking of daily stress level
· Checking the effects of favorite meals and drinks on stress

Flow represents a new chapter in the understanding and treatment of depression, based on the latest psychology and neuroscience research.

The app can be used on its own and offers a therapy programme with over 50 therapy sessions. The sessions cover a range of topics from behavioural therapy and lifestyle habits, such as, meditation, sleep, diet and exercise. To track changes over time, the app includes the MADRS-s depression test.

Together with the Flow brain stimulation headset, the app offers a holistic approach to treating depression. The type of stimulation used in the Flow headset, transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS), has long been used in clinical settings to treat depression. With Flow, you can now access tDCS in a remote device from your own home. To use the headset you will need the app. 

The Flow treatment is based on decades of clinical research and is supported by more than 20 randomised double-blind studies. The Flow headset is approved as a medical device (CE) in the EU and UK for the treatment of depression. Order it at: https://flowneuroscience.com

The programme contains over 50 sessions split into 7 courses, covering topics such as:

- Exercise

Physical exercise has been shown to have a similar effect to antidepressant medication when it comes to reducing and preventing depressive symptoms. Flow will tell you what type of exercise is beneficial and the optimal “dose”.

- Meditation

Meditation is practised by many people around the world as mental “exercise” for the brain. Flow will give you concrete exercises to follow but also show you the neurological basis of why meditation is good for managing stress in your everyday life.

- Sleep

Did you know that sleeping for only six hours each night for two nights in a row is equivalent to being continuously awake for 24 hours? Flow will educate you on sleep hygiene, why we sleep and why sleeping is one of four important pillars for overcoming depression.

- Nutrition

The nutrition sessions will advise and encourage you to eat in a way that science has proven reduces inflammation in the brain, thereby alleviating depression. Spoiler alert: sugar is one of the big villains.","10,000+",4.0,Health & Fitness,USD,0.0,True

Depression,Dealing with Depression,https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/r4mS3D0yEFHbyMuHGkzx_n5f0ts1MBAMVaYcV7Ws61NkAP4rOQC96j-6sgH8SbCdDdSQ,"Depression is an extreme low mood that lasts a long time and makes a person feel sad,
irritable or empty. Many people, including many teens, have suffered in this way. A
depressed person:
^ has much less energy to do activities
^ feels like nothing matters.
^ sees life in a negative way.
^ feels like it will never get better
But depressed people do get better and depression does end. There are effective
treatments and self-help skills to deal with depression. Health care professionals give
depression treatments, but you can learn self help skills and apply them to your own life. This guide teaches a set of antidepressant skills you can use to overcome depression. Sometimes the skills can be used on their own, when the depression
isn’t too severe. Sometimes they have to be used along with treatments by professionals.
Dealing with Depression is meant for those who have been coping with depressed mood. Some of the things in this guide will make more sense to younger teens and some will make more sense to older ones. But check it out for yourself. Decide which parts of this guide make sense for your life.
This Depression Test is designed to help you evaluate the severity of your depression with just nine simple questions. This app uses the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9), an empirically-based, self-test questionnaire. Clinical depression is a mood disorder in which feelings of sadness, loss, anger, or frustration interfere with everyday life for weeks or longer. Clinical depression generally responds positively to treatment, so it is important to seek treatment if you are concerned about your mental health.
 DISCLAIMER: This self-test is not meant to be a diagnosis for your depression. Remember that this app should not be used as a replacement for professional treatment or guidance.
Do you suffer from depression? Depression may stem from a personal tragedy or from sad unexpected events or circumstances. It does not discriminate its victims. Depression can affect anyone regardless of their background, race, age, income, etc.
The natural management of depression involves understanding depression and the factors that contribute to the symptoms. Learning to manage stress in your life and engage in self-care behaviors can improve your symptoms and your mood.
Depression is one of the most prevalent and treatable mental disorders. Diagnosis of depression is based on the presence of certain symptoms that significantly impair function for a certain duration. These symptoms are described in the DSM-IV, the diagnostic manual for mental disorders. 
This app is designed to help with Depression treatment and controlling stress by advising mood enhancing foods, teaching the importance of writing wellness journals and how to get adequate sleep during depressive episodes.
Dealing with Depression app is an app that helps you diagnose the level of depression you have, and based on that it gives you the suitable solution for your depression level, in some cases depression is only a result of anxiety and some passing problems, but if the person did not get out of that condition then his condition might advance, we will give you some ways to avoid the advancement of your situation, if the depression is severe we will guide you to what to do as soon as possible
Depression is common but many people don't admit to it. Some people feel there is a stigma attached, or that people will think they are weak. Great leaders such as Winston Churchill have had depression. Depression is one of the most common illnesses that GPs deal with. People with depression may be told by others to ""pull their socks up"" or ""snap out of it"". The truth is, they cannot and such comments by others are very unhelpful.
Depression (major depressive disorder) is a common and serious medical illness that negatively affects how you feel, the way you think and how you act. Fortunately, it is also treatable. Depression causes feelings of sadness and/or a loss of interest.","10,000+",3.7777777,Health & Fitness,USD,0.0,True

Depression,CBT Thought Diary,https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/SZJvxFP4TzJytlenSEbCOtm-8FSxHy9KQ3-fkQ1tBSZekzpnWfrQDuFTBxTc-AhUfzYN,"* THE BEST JOURNAL APP TO IMPROVE YOUR MOOD *

CBT Thought Diary is a journal with a purpose: it uses effective tools from Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT), Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT), Dialectical Behavioral Therapy (DBT), and Positive Psychology to help improve your mood.

Do you feel like you're always stressed, anxious, sad, frustrated, or unmotivated? The centerpiece of cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) is learning to identify negative and distorted thinking patterns to change your emotions and your behaviors for the better. In CBT, a ""thought record"" guides you through the steps of identifying, challenging, and reinterpreting negative thinking patterns. With Thought Diary, you can document your negative emotions, analyze flaws in your thinking, and re-evaluate your negative thoughts into more balanced ones. It may even help you recognize helpful ways to deal with your negative behaviors and emotions for future situations.

CBT Thought Diary can do more than thought records, though! It can also be used as a daily mood tracker. You can even practice gratitude by creating positive entries using our flexible diary entry format. According to positive psychology, appreciating the positives in our lives can improve happiness and meaning.
 
With CBT Thought Diary, you can gradually change your approach to how you interpret the ups and downs of life, making long-lasting changes in your mental well-being.

According to positive psychology, practicing gratitude and recording positive emotions is important as well. Thought Diary also allows you to keep track of your positive experiences so that you can refer back to them and appreciate the good moments, as well as note down what particular things you're grateful for. This way, you can be more aware and thankful of the positive moments in life.

Thought Diary will help you evaluate, understand, and change your thoughts and feelings. By using this application, you can work to identify your emotions, analyze how and why you're feeling this way, challenge those negative beliefs, change your thinking patterns for future situations, and remember positive experiences. You can use this app as a mood journal, a thought record journal, and a gratitude journal.

Thought Records and Gratitude Journals similar to this app are commonly used in paper form in traditional cognitive-behavioral therapy for a variety of mental health disorders such as clinical depression and anxiety. If you are suffering from a mental health disorder, please consult a mental health professional or healthcare provider.

It does this by combining guided instructions and focused attention with bilateral brain stimulation. Bilateral stimulation is a treatment element of EMDR (Eye Movement Desensitization & Reprocessing), a revolutionary treatment which is based on the use of sensory stimulation to alter anxiety-provoking memories and responses. Over 30 randomized controlled studies of EMDR attest to the efficacy of this process.  The author also has two research studies in submission with peer-reviewed scientific journals based on this process.

Because bilateral stimulation appeals to the unconscious, sensing part of the brain, there is no need for effortful thinking or struggling with feelings. All you have to do is LISTEN and your brain will do the rest! The App consists of; 
1 x brain training session 
2 x guided anxiety management sessions 
1 x pure bilateral stimulation session (audio & visual) 
1 x safe place exercise 
Progress Log function with prompts
Powerful Bls brain visual simulating brain activity associated with anxiety reduction

You're not feeling your best. You might call it stress, anxiety, depression, low mood, or something completely different. What you do know is that you want to do something about it.

So where do you begin?

<b>Enter the world of MoodSpace</b>
MoodSpace brings together techniques from cognitive behavioural therapy, mindfulness based cognitive therapy, positive psychology, and behavioural activation into a self-help space for mental wellbeing to guide you in managing and improving your mental health.
Techniques such as recognising three good things in a gratitude journal and balancing automatic thoughts in the cbt thought record are grounded in decades of research on what makes us happy.

<i>Three Clouds</i> 
Notice life's good moments by writing a delightful three good things in a gratitude journal and note the good things that are all too often forgotten.

Three Clouds is based on the gratitude journal from Positive Psychotherapy. By writing three good things each day the aim is to reduce worry, improve self-esteem, help cope with stress, and more.

<i>Thought Diary</i> 
Look at stressful situations in a healthy, balanced way. Prevent rumination by using the thought record to challenge automatic thinking and gain a new understanding of stressful situations.

The thought dairy (or thought record) is a tool used in CBT to reframe thinking. By analysing thinking patterns in the cbt thought record it helps you to recognise and balance unhelpful thought patterns.

<i>Guided Meditation</i>
Focus on your breath, re-focus, and become more mindful by learning to meditate. Take your first steps into mindfulness by listening to a selection of guided meditations. Or use the custom meditation timer with a selection of calming nature sounds. Cultivating this sense of mindfulness can help prevent rumination and help cope with stress. 

<i>Day Planner</i>
Schedule your time in this activity planner based on what brings you fulfilment. Rediscover what brings you happiness and make the plans that bring those things back into your life. Ensure your life has balance by making plans around work, fun, and rest to help reduce stress.

<b>At your fingertips</b>
MoodSpace techniques are designed to be as simple as possible to use.

The three good things technique can be used daily to keep track of the little things. And this gratitude journal can be looked back on in the future whenever you're in need of a smile.

The thought diary cbt is good to use at a moments notice when a stressful situation occurs. To quickly cope with stress and get back on with your day.

<b>A wellbeing app driven by the research</b>

If you suffer from anxiety or depression, you are far from being alone: It has been estimated that today, there are over 260 million people around the world dealing with depression and 280 million dealing with anxiety. 

MoodSpace takes its techniques from decades of research on what helps in dealing with anxiety and dealing with depression, and brings those techniques to your fingertips.

The app aims to create a self-help space where you will have the opportunity to experiment with techniques backed by research to see what works for you. 

Using this knowledge, we encourage you to carry out your own, further research into your favourite techniques. Your continued learning can build the coping strategies which enable you to cope with stress and manage low mood

The information to bring you happiness is out there but therapy is all too often prohibitively expensive or inaccessible. We think everyone should have access to these tools. 

You will never be alone, and we hope this app will provide the self-help tools which guide you to a happier life.

----------

MoodSpace isn't a replacement for therapy or treatment – it's simply an introduction to mental wellbeing techniques and provides a self-help space to learn about yourself.

While particular individuals get angry more often than others and have regular, intense outbursts, others tend to bottle their feelings and then blow up or flare up without warning. 

Anger is a basic human emotion and a natural response to situations beyond our control. There are a lot of things that may set off or contribute to anger, like the actions of another individual, an event, tension, expectations not being met, feeling hurt, contempt, humiliation, embarrassment, jealousy and sorrow.

Depending upon how it's dealt with and expressed, anger may be favorable or damaging. It has favorable effects when angry feelings help you address an issue or subject with yourself or a different individual and correct the situation.

Handling anger positively enables you to put damaging emotions into perspective. When you wish to let off steam, feel frustrated or distressed, there are constructive methods to channel your anger like listening to music or going to gym. These are frequently utilized in treating anger disorders.

But, expressing anger in a negative way frequently leads to assorted unhealthy behaviors like violence and aggression. You might get out of control and threatening to other people.

An anti-stress and anti-panic game for gaining optimism and getting rid of irritability.
Press the button and shout as hard as you can! Free yourself from your accumulated emotions, surprise the app’s character with the power of your scream! Blow off steam! 
Warning — a therapeutic effect is possible:)

Shout it out, dear friend — you will definitely feel better.

Features:
-Mood tracker
-Stress timeline
-Scream power tracker
-Journal of your emotions

There are times when things don't go the way you want them to — it causes stress. We are all familiar with stress and even know how to deal with it a little. 

But at the peak of your emotions, it's a good idea not to leave them deep inside but to let them out through your body. Jumping, squatting, dancing — anything will work but there's one more wonderful way — SHOUTING AND SCREAMING! Not aimed at a specific target (don't shout at someone, please :) shouting is liberating and calming.
 
When we scream to release our emotions as intensely as possible we are charging ourselves with new energy. 

Anxiety and stress relief games and apps are a great way to reduce your stress level and calm your nerves. And also our “Antistress” voice game and mood diary - a cool tool for reflection and a valuable contribution to your self care and self help. 

How to interact with the app:
Choose the right mood — the character's little faces will show you the degree of (un)satisfaction. Registering your feelings makes you aware, and being conscious makes it easier for you to cope with everyday stress, anger and anxiety.

A timeline or stress chart keeps track of your emotions and moods. It also helps you to keep track of your worst days so you can identify tendencies of mental decline and try to get your balance back in life.

When you're angry, when you're drained of patience and energy, when you feel you're about to lose it — press the yellow button and shout!

As you scream, the app will rate the strength of your scream. Then the scream voice power is shown on the graph and you'll be able to observe which days you let off steam particularly effectively.

In a calendar or a mood journal you can record the events of the day and your feelings during them. Together with a stress and scream power chart such a mental health diary will save and browse your happy and not so happy days. 
It would be great to have fewer ""terrible"" moods on your mood calendar.

Blow off steam! or Vent! App “Anger management” gently supports, encourages you to get rid of anxiety, stress, rage and other negative emotions with an ecological approach and tracks your mood. 

Calming games and apps are a perfect stress reliever and stress management method. Besides, it is a good emotion tracker and mood controller.

Get your emotions in the right direction! Shout them out here — blow off steam, don't keep it inside!

Anger is an emotion that usually brings out the worst in everyone and is usually displayed in regrettable ways. However, most people constantly give in to the displays of anger, instead of taking the trouble to find and address the source of the anger, in the quest to redefine this very negative emotion. 

In most relationships the feelings of being unfairly treated is usually the trigger for the anger emotion. Relationships already have a lot of expectations and pressures to deal with, without having the extra and possibly destructive addition of the anger emotion being prevalently displayed. Learning the deal with anger issue within a relationship before is causes the downfall should be seriously considered.

Anger and depression are more closely related than you think, and losing anger can now make it more difficult to overcome depression later. Learning to control your depression often depends, in part, on how you can control your anger.

How anger management quotes can help you?

You might think that venting your anger is healthy, that the people around you are too sensitive, that your anger is justified, or that you need to show your fury to get respect. But the truth is that anger is much more likely to damage your relationships, impair your judgment, get in the way of success, and have a negative impact on the way people see you. That’s where anger management comes in.

The goal of anger management?

Many people think that anger management is about learning to suppress your anger. But never getting angry is not a good goal. Anger is normal, and it will come out regardless of how hard you try to tamp it down. The true goal of anger management isn’t to suppress feelings of anger but rather to understand the message behind the emotion and express it in a healthy way without losing control. When you do, you’ll not only feel better, you’ll also be more likely to get your needs met, be better able to manage conflict in your life, and strengthen your relationships.

The app provides users with education about anger, opportunities for finding support, the ability to create an anger management plan, anger tracking, and tools to help manage angry reactions.

Anger management,How To Control Anger,https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/8Ul56Jyj5b4oHgPNqir3vBcASN2FOyAARUKIZehK0aZidjTJKOZJAlfZzj-RRcdvjwU,"Anger is a common reaction to many of the stressful experiences people have during everyday life. The stress of military life, such as the emotional toll of deployments and separations, can begin to affect your psychological health.

If anger is affecting your daily life, it may be time to reach out for help. Not handling anger properly can negatively impact relationships with loved ones or colleagues, as well as your overall health by increasing your risk of a heart attack, stroke, hypertension and more. Your health care provider can teach you how to manage anger, discuss how it affects you and help you gain new skills to respond to it more practically.

Anger is a normal feeling and can be a positive emotion when it helps you work through issues or problems, whether thats at work or at home.

However, anger can become problematic if it leads to aggression, outbursts, or even physical altercations.

Anger control is important for helping you avoid saying or doing something you may regret. Before anger escalates, you can use specific strategies for controlling anger.

Many respond with a fear of being hurt, fear of not being able to stand up for oneself, or fear of unjust or unfair things happening. These are all reasonable responses.

But anger is not aggressiveness. Anger may lead to aggressiveness, but when we feel angry, we can try to relate to it in a way that invokes feelings of wisdom, strength, courage and assertiveness.


Tips to manage your anger

Identify the triggers for your anger, such as environments and people.

Notice the bodily warning signs of anger: tightness in shoulders, increased heart rate, hot face.

Draw on a strategy that works for you. This could include slowing down your breathing, imagery, evaluating your thoughts, taking time out and changing your environment, or using relaxation skills.","1,000+",0.0,Books & Reference,USD,0.0,True

From a very early age, people learn to express anger by copying the angry behavior they see modeled around them, and by expressing angry behavior and seeing what they can get away with. As many cultures have an uneasy relationship with anger expression, many people are brought up to think that it is inappropriate to express anger directly; that it must not be tolerated; that it is always dangerous. Such people learn to distrust anger, to bottle it up and ignore it, to express it only in indirect ways or to use it as a weapon",500+,0.0,Entertainment,USD,0.0,True

If you have a friend contemplating suicide, you may be scared and unsure how you can reach out to help them. You may be worried you may say the wrong thing or afraid you can’t handle the responsibility. 

How to Help a Suicidal Friend
Having a friend who you believe to be considering suicide is not to be taken lightly. Being suicidal is a temporary state that appears as an answer to severe depression, and the act of taking one's own life is preventable when the correct measures are taken. As a friend, you can potentially save a life by paying attention to warning signs of suicide (in addition to the ones you already know about), making your friend feel supported, and knowing when and how to get outside help. If your friend is in immediate danger call 911, or 1-800-SUICIDE to talk to professionals and access necessary resources.

How to Talk Someone out of Suicide
If someone is considering suicide, your first move should always be to call emergency services, such as dialing 911 or the National Suicide Hotline (1-800-273-TALK) in the US. The two most important things you can do with someone considering suicide are to listen and keep them in your sight at all times. Talking someone out of suicide is a difficult process, and you should always contact professionals to handle this delicate situation.

How to Handle a Suicidal Teenager
Suicide is the third leading cause of death for 15-24-year-olds. Girls tend to think about suicide and attempt suicide about twice as often as boys, yet boys die by suicide 4 times more often that girls. Contemplating suicide is a big deal for a teen, and a scary situation for parents. When dealing with a suicidal teen, remain calm and remember that you can handle this.

How to Help Someone Who Is Thinking About Committing Suicide
If you have reason to believe that someone you know is contemplating suicide, you should get help immediately. Whether your friend told you they were thinking of suicide or you just sense a possibility, you should act; doing so can save a life. Call the US National Suicide Prevention Lifeline at 1-800-273-TALK (8255) or 1-800-SUICIDE (1-800-784-2433) or the UK Suicide hotline at 116 123 to learn more about how to provide assistance and find local suicide prevention resources.

How to Empathize with People Who Have Suicidal Tendencies
Over 800,000 people die due to suicide every year and there are many more who try to attempt it. Having suicidal tendencies is actually a call for help that shouldn’t be ignored by the society.

Suicide prevention,Don't panic,https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/mqKO0R3ipzMX15mnG-PGx1d7mIEdVXPmW_Kc8HEwrxYEB_byJbQTgX3cN-9O6KhaDp8,"The app has sevenbasic modules: depression, anxiety & panic attacks, self-harm, suicidal thoughts, mood monitoring, eating disorder and professional help resources.

The module DEPRESSION contains the WHAT CAN HELP ME feature, including suggestions that could help the user feel better (e.g. exercise, meditation, listening to music, watching videos, drawing, guided relaxation). ACTIVITY PLANNER, which motivates the user to create a to-do list of tasks (check off, edit or delete the accomplished goals anytime) and WHAT MADE ME HAPPY to help the individual focus on the positives of the past day.

The module ANXIETY & PANIC ATTACKS aims on helping the user overcome intense feelings of anxiety and panic attacks. It includes two types of breathing exercises, designed to immediately help the individual to calm down. The first exercise focuses on deep breathing only – switching between inhaling and exhaling. The second exercise is focused on the ‚box breathing‘ technique– full inhale, holding your breath, full exhale and again holding your breath.

Another feature included in this module is COUNTING of simple mathematical equations to help the user focus on something other than the anxious thoughts and physical reactions that accompany each panic attack. The equations are automatically generated and include addition, subtraction and multiplication of numbers 0 to 9, and are immediately corrected. The last feature in this module includes more suggestions on what to do when feeling anxious (e.g. breathing exercise, count from 100 to 0, watch your favourite film etc.)

The module SELF HARM tries to distract from the urges. Once again it provides two breathing exercises. The feature WHAT CAN HELP ME includes suggestions what to do instead of hurting yourself (take an ice-cube or red marker and move it across your skin where you would usually hurt yourself, write down your emotions and describe how you feel and then destroy the piece of paper, scream, exercise or try to diffuse the intense emotions through painting or guided relaxation).

The SUICIDAL THOUGHTS module provides a list of reasons and activities and which could prevent the thoughts or at least show the value of one‘s life. The users create their own EMERGENCY PLANS. The app enables the user to make list of safe activities as an alternative scenario to follow in crisis. The plan includes: who will I contact, what will I say/write, what will I do or where will I go in case of an emergency. It is ideal to create the plan when one is able to think rationally or with the help of another person. This feature also includes a list of people who care about the individual and would potentially be hurt by his actions.

In the REASONS TO STAY ALIVE section, users can create a list of people, things and activities they like or care about enough to stop them from committing suicide. There are a few default entries in the list for users to have an idea what kind of reasons they might put in. And again – the breathing exercises are included in the SUICIDAL THOUGHT module.

In the last module – PROFESSIONAL HELP RESOURCES – there is a list of phone numbers with the option of directly calling the ambulance, hot lines and crisis centres. We also included links to chat rooms in case anyone prefers typing over speaking.

Clinical depression generally responds positively to treatment, so it is important to seek treatment if you are concerned about your mental health.

Different therapists have different approaches and areas of expertise so we’ll work with you to find the right person who can achieve the best results for you.

CBT Thought Diary is a journal with a purpose: it uses effective tools from Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT), Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT), Dialectical Behavioral Therapy (DBT), and Positive Psychology to help improve your mood.

Do you feel like you're always stressed, anxious, sad, frustrated, or unmotivated? The centerpiece of cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) is learning to identify negative and distorted thinking patterns to change your emotions and your behaviors for the better. In CBT, a ""thought record"" guides you through the steps of identifying, challenging, and reinterpreting negative thinking patterns. With Thought Diary, you can document your negative emotions, analyze flaws in your thinking, and re-evaluate your negative thoughts into more balanced ones. It may even help you recognize helpful ways to deal with your negative behaviors and emotions for future situations.

CBT Thought Diary can do more than thought records, though! It can also be used as a daily mood tracker. You can even practice gratitude by creating positive entries using our flexible diary entry format. According to positive psychology, appreciating the positives in our lives can improve happiness and meaning.
 
With CBT Thought Diary, you can gradually change your approach to how you interpret the ups and downs of life, making long-lasting changes in your mental well-being.

According to positive psychology, practicing gratitude and recording positive emotions is important as well. Thought Diary also allows you to keep track of your positive experiences so that you can refer back to them and appreciate the good moments, as well as note down what particular things you're grateful for. This way, you can be more aware and thankful of the positive moments in life.

Thought Diary will help you evaluate, understand, and change your thoughts and feelings. By using this application, you can work to identify your emotions, analyze how and why you're feeling this way, challenge those negative beliefs, change your thinking patterns for future situations, and remember positive experiences. You can use this app as a mood journal, a thought record journal, and a gratitude journal.

Thought Records and Gratitude Journals similar to this app are commonly used in paper form in traditional cognitive-behavioral therapy for a variety of mental health disorders such as clinical depression and anxiety. If you are suffering from a mental health disorder, please consult a mental health professional or healthcare provider.

With drug availability in our culture being on the forefront of our minds, it is no surprise that not people realize that this is a problem and can be highly addicting. Drug Addiction Calendar can help you put an end to your drug addiction by holding you accountable, offering solutions, words of encouragement, and science based facts that will help you get past your drug abuse.
 
Features:
1. Use our counter to track your progress down to the second.
2. Create your own reasons to quit drugs, or use one of our scientifically based facts about quitting.
3. Change the look and feel of the app with our skins section to personalize the app to what you want.

5. Our special panic button will help you send a text to a friend that may be able to help you and be an accountability partner.

8. Our built in money calculator will show you how much money you have saved since quitting
9. Our motivational quotes and testimonials will ensure that you are not alone on this process to shake your drug addiction. 
 
Take a look at our top 10 reasons to quit using Drugs:

1. Stop the pain!

When you are addicted to drugs, everything you do becomes more painful when you are not on the drugs. Eventually this will fade, but it can be grueling at first, which is why people become addicts in the first place.

2. Change your life

When you look back on your life, do you want to see the person who was addicted to drugs and not contributing to society? I don't think so.

3. Regain your self-esteem

Drugs will get you into a cycle of self-loathing and hate. This is a situation that no one wants to be in. When you are addicted to drugs, you start to think that you are worthless and no one likes you.

4. Be a good parent

It is not just you suffering from a drug addiction; your children are suffering too. Children need a role model to look up to and if that role model is addicted to drugs, then they are going to see that as normal. Even if they never see you use drugs, children will gravitate towards that state of mind.

5. Be a loving spouse

Drug use negatively affects relationships, whether its friendships, dating relationships, families, or marriages. Your spouse needs you to be there for them emotionally and physically. When you are using drugs, you are not there emotionally.

6. Stop being embarrassed

When you are addicted to drugs, pretty much everything you do can be embarrassing. Your family and friends will stop inviting you to places simply because you make a fool out of yourself.

7. Remember the good times

Being addicted to drugs prevents you from remembering the good experiences in life. You absolutely do not need drugs to have a good time, and when you start remembering things more, you will appreciate the good times even more.

8. Be respected by your peers

As a child, you looked up to your parents because they provided for you and gave you unconditional love. At this stage in your life, you need to feel respected in that same way, but the more you use drugs, the less opportunity you are going to have to be respected.

9. Provide for your family

According to Clarity Detox, the average drug addict spends approximately $2,100 - $4,200 per month on various drugs, including heroin and prescription drugs.

10. Develop more friendships 

When you are a drug user, you put your friends on the back burner and using drugs take precedent to being a good friend. You used to know what it was like to be a good friend before you started using drugs, right?

AntiSocial is designed to not only help you understand what ‘normal usage’ looks like, but to give you the tools to manage, block and control your cell phone usage so that you can unplug, minimize distractions and focus on the things that matter.
While there are other apps available that are designed to restrict phone usage, AntiSocial feels strongly about empowering the user by giving them the information they need to take necessary action. This is done through the clearest and most simple interface available and is the only app to deliver detailed reports full of all the information you need to make an informed decision.

What makes AntiSocial unique?
★ Your cell phone usage will be benchmarked against all other users. Get an understanding of what is ‘normal usage’

Knowledge is power, and from there it’s up to you whether you want or need to take action to control your cell phone usage. The app offers the ability to manage, block apps and restrict usage but again, this is entirely up to the user. 
AntiSocial empowers you to take control of your phone time and minimize distraction. We understand that controlling cell phone usage may be a bigger problem for some than others which is why on top of delivering information to the user, you can also take action by blocking apps, disabling apps and restricting your usage to give you some much needed off time if you’re feeling addicted. And while it may not be a catastrophic problem yet, it is becoming harder for us to unplug and disconnect from our phones. We understand it can be difficult to avoid the distraction of our cell phones, especially when it comes to studying, working or downtime. The ability to block games and block social media can go a long way to achieving a better mental state and minimizing distraction so you can focus on what’s important.

Methis illegal, but our culture promotes meth and drug use as something that is cool. It is easy to see why people end up addicted to meth. 
 
Quit Meth Addiction Calendar addresses the need to quit meth, and helps you become accountable for making the changes happen!
 
Features:
1. Use our counter to track your progress down to the second.
2. Create your own reasons to quit meth, or use one of our scientifically based facts about quitting.
3. Change the look and feel of the app with our skins section to personalize the app to what you want.
4. Add reasons why you would like to see yourself succeed and stop using meth.
5. Our special panic button will help you send a text to a friend that may be able to help you and be an accountability partner.

9. Our motivational quotes and testimonials will ensure that you are not alone on this process to shake your meth addiction. 
10. Our built in time counter will let you know how much time you save per day since quitting. 
 
Here are our top 6 reasons to quit meth:
 
1. Chronic meth use will cause permanent brain damage
 
Meth affects the chemical makeup of the brain, and repeated use can lead to permanent damage. The National Institute on Drug Abuse suggests that long-term meth abuse leads to psychological disorders like paranoia, schizophrenia, anxiety and depression. 
 
2. Those using meth are likely to end up in the emergency room
 
Since then numbers of emergency room visits have continued to rise. The sooner you quit using the meth you sooner you stop losing control of your actions, which are erratic and might severely injure you or those close to you.
 
3. Meth causes erratic behavior, often leading to legal issues
 
Those who are addicted to meth will exhibit erratic behavior, ranging from violent outbursts to mood swings and an inability to weigh potential consequences. Meth causes people to act in ways they would never act if they were sober. A combination of irrational thinking and erratic behavior lead to legal issues.
 
4. The sooner you quit meth, the sooner you will be able to stop living in constant fear of legal issues
 
This goes without saying. If you are constantly out doing meth and committing crimes, you are much more likely to have looming legal issues that will eventually catch up to you. 
 
5. Your physical appearance will be improve drastically
 
Meth abuse causes major changes to appearance. Meth is an appetite suppressant that leads to extreme weight loss. Those that use meth are inclined to pick at their skin, leaving open wounds, sores and scabs. Eyes become sunken-in and permanent damage to the nasal cavities can occur if meth is being snorted.

Take a look at our top 8 reasons to quit shopping:
 
1. Being addicted to shopping means that you have less time for social activity
 
Shopping is a good escape from reality, but it can become too much of a burden when you are constantly buying random items and mindlessly surfing the internet, looking for other things to buy.
 
2. Shopping addiction can lead to worse things
 
When you are addicted to shopping, you will be exposed to many other opportunities to buy things. You might even think that buying drugs could be your next adventure. This is a bad idea. No shopping is the best shopping.
 
3. More time to spend with your family
 
Family bonding is an important thing in modern culture. With so many distractions including shopping, spending time with family or planning a game night will do wonders for you relationships.
 
4. More time for hobbies
 
Shopping addiction takes away from time that you could be spending doing what was once your favorite hobby. Or maybe you can take up a new hobby. Just find a way to get away from shopping
 
5. Are you lying about your shopping addiction?
 
If you have been lying about your shopping addiction, it is safe to say that you might have a problem. The first step to healing is admitting that you have a problem. This can be hard to do, but help is here.
 
6. Curbing your shopping time
 
A good way to fight shopping addiction is to cut back on your time spent on shopping. There are many good resources online that will force you into certain time blocks on your computer and block access to online stores during the others.
 
7. Mindlessly shopping at work
 
If you find yourself searching the internet and shopping for random things when you have deadlines to attend to, you might be addicted to shopping. It is important to know when you stray too far. Keep yourself on the right track.
 
8. Restless or moody feelings
 
When you are addicted to shopping, nothing can fill that gap of satisfaction that shopping gives you. You might be on a boat and you can’t stop thinking about checking that next big deal, or when the next 50% off sale is going to be.

* Weekday level usage details - Do you use your mobile a lot on weekends? If we know that we are spending a lot of time on mobile when we are free then maybe we can start focusing our effort to utilize our time on something more productive rather than browsing aimlessly on mobile phones.

Just by reducing your daily mobile usage 2 min per hour you can save more than an hour of time in a day. This time can be utilized for learning a new skill, going to gym or spending some quality time with friends and family.

Facing obstacles alone can be daunting – receiving support and guidance from a professional therapist has been shown to make huge, positive changes to help you overcome personal challenges. When you sign up we’ll match you to an available therapist who fits your objectives, preferences and the type of issues you’re dealing with. Different therapists have different approaches and areas of expertise so we’ll work with you to find the right person who can achieve the best results for you.

All of our therapists have a Master’s Degree or a Doctorate Degree in their respective fields. They have been qualified and certified by their state professional board and have completed the necessary education, exams, training, and practice.

Problems with your partner that leave you needing <b>mental support</b>?

Is your work inducing <b>stress</b> and <b>anxiety,</b> making each day harder to get through?

Are you tired of <b>mental health apps</b> that focus only on <b>meditation?</b>

If you seek <b>mental relief</b> and <b>better help</b> for <b>mental health</b> that goes beyond <b>mindfulness</b>...

You're in the right place.

Hi there, Welcome to being 👋

A unique <b>self-therapy app</b> (read: buddy) that <b>care</b>s.

Your <b>mental health friend</b> and <b>self-care guide</b>.

<b>meditation</b> and <b>mindfulness alone</b> can't <b>support mental well-being</b>.

Why? Because mental health means feelings, countless feelings that we experience every single day. 

And <b>being</b> has something for <b>all</b> of them. 

A <b>therapy app</b> that goes beyond traditional <b>mindfulness practices</b> to address what you're feeling in the moment.

Be it <b>stress</b>, <b>depression</b>, <b>anxiety relief</b>, <b>productivity</b>, loneliness, or any mental and emotional struggle you are battling,

being seeks to understand you, to help you GROW through what you GO through.

HOW?

<b>being</b> offers you small, easy, and simple steps for <b>self-improvement.</b>

When you're lonely, upset, anxious, or depressed,

When you can't <b>sleep</b> or question your existence,

Even when you don't know what you are feeling…

<b>Try A Mini-Therapy 💖</b>

A mini-<b>therapy</b> is a bite-sized <b>therapy</b> session.

<b>Professionally created</b>, short, interactive, and hyper-personalized

For all your emotions… known or unknown.

The best part? Start feeling better in under 10 minutes. 🤗

When you need <b>mental relief</b> or <b>therapy</b>, give <b>Mini-therapy</b> a try.

<b>Form Mini-Habits 🌻</b>

Mini-habits help you practice self-acceptance and <b>self-care</b> through small steps,

And support <b>anxiety release</b> by helping you be in the moment :)

Let <b>Music Therapy 🎵</b> help you <b>find mental love</b>.

Anytime is a good time for <b>self-care,</b> whatever the mood.

And being has a playlist for <b>every</b> mood, emotion, and activity.

Even a few minutes of being's <b>Music Therapy</b> enables <b>anxiety relief.</b> ✨

Some <b>mental health apps</b> deliver <b>meditation</b> or mindfulness advice.

And some people may shame you for talking about your emotions (or ask you to “go take a walk”)

But not <b>being</b>.

<b>being</b> recognizes that <b>mental health</b> is a continuous and lifelong journey.

And when it comes to <b>coping</b> with <b>anxiety and depression,</b>

Every day is different. Some days are more challenging than others…

No matter what, <b>being</b> will be your <b>mental health friend</b> on all kinds of days, even the hardest ones.

With:

✔ Science-backed tools like <b>CBT</b> & <b>DMT</b>

✔ Calming & Focus Music

✔ Journal prompts 

✔ Affirmations 

✔ and much more!

You see, <b>self-help</b> is the most important kind of help for <b>personal well-being</b>.

But what if you also had a bit of guidance and a whole lot of <b>care</b> and love to go along? Enter <b>being.</b>

We can't promise that there won't be tough times;

But even on days when you can't see a single ray of light,

<b>being</b>'s got your back.

Your <b>mental health</b> is safe with <b>being</b>! Promise!

Now take a few minutes to relax and just be :)

-------------------------------------------
<b>REGAIN – FEATURES</b>
-------------------------------------------
• Get therapy on your own or with your partner
• All therapists are licensed, trained, accredited and highly experienced in providing relationship support
• Complete a short survey to be matched with a therapist who best fits your needs
• Unlimited private communication with your therapist
• Schedule live sessions with your therapist or use the secure messenger

<b>PROFESSIONAL HELP, PERSONALIZED FOR YOU</b>
Relationship problems can be painful and challenging. Support and guidance from a professional therapist has been shown to make big, positive changes. We created Regain so anyone can have convenient, discreet, and affordable access to professional help.
Common relationship problems people seek help for are difficulty communicating, high levels of conflict, disagreement over finances, children, or in-laws, and problems with infidelity, to name just a few.

<b>LICENSED AND TRAINED THERAPISTS</b>
All therapists on Regain have at least 3 years and 1,000 hours of hands-on experience. They are licensed, trained, experienced and accredited psychologists (PhD/PsyD), marriage and family therapists (MFT), clinical social workers (LCSW), licensed professional counselors (LPC), or similar credentials.

All of our therapists have a Master’s Degree or a Doctorate Degree in their respective fields. They have been qualified and certified by their state professional board and have completed the necessary education, exams, training and practice.

<b>HOW DOES IT WORK?</b>
After filling out our questionnaire, you will be matched with a licensed therapist based on your needs and preferences. You and your therapist will get your own secure and private “therapy room” where you can message your therapist at any time, from any internet-connected device, wherever you are. Your partner will be invited to this room as well if you decide to try therapy together. You can also schedule a session so speak live with your therapist over video or phone.

You can write or talk about yourself, the things going on in your life, ask questions and discuss the challenges you’re facing and your therapist will provide feedback, insights and guidance. This ongoing dialogue is the foundation of your work with your therapist.

If you choose to try therapy on ReGain with your partner (either at the start of therapy, or if you choose to invite them later), your dialogue would be between all three of you: you, your partner, and your therapist. Together you will work towards making a positive change in your relationship and accomplishing your goals.

<b>HOW MUCH DOES IT COST?</b>
The cost of therapy through Regain ranges from $60 to $90 per week (billed every 4 weeks) but may be higher based on your location, preferences, and therapist availability. Unlike traditional in-office therapy which can cost over $150 for a single session, your Regain membership includes unlimited text, video, audio messaging as well as weekly live sessions. The subscription is billed and renewed every 4 weeks and includes both the use of the secured site and the counseling service itself.

Dialectical behavior therapy (DBT) treatment is a type of psychotherapy — or talk therapy — that utilizes a cognitive-behavioral approach.

Empirical evidence now supports the use of DBT adapted for eating disorders, substance use disorders, and PTSD.

Therapy,CBT Thought Diary,https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/SZJvxFP4TzJytlenSEbCOtm-8FSxHy9KQ3-fkQ1tBSZekzpnWfrQDuFTBxTc-AhUfzYN,"* THE BEST JOURNAL APP TO IMPROVE YOUR MOOD *

CBT Thought Diary is a journal with a purpose: it uses effective tools from Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT), Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT), Dialectical Behavioral Therapy (DBT), and Positive Psychology to help improve your mood.

Do you feel like you're always stressed, anxious, sad, frustrated, or unmotivated? The centerpiece of cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) is learning to identify negative and distorted thinking patterns to change your emotions and your behaviors for the better. In CBT, a ""thought record"" guides you through the steps of identifying, challenging, and reinterpreting negative thinking patterns. With Thought Diary, you can document your negative emotions, analyze flaws in your thinking, and re-evaluate your negative thoughts into more balanced ones. It may even help you recognize helpful ways to deal with your negative behaviors and emotions for future situations.

CBT Thought Diary can do more than thought records, though! It can also be used as a daily mood tracker. You can even practice gratitude by creating positive entries using our flexible diary entry format. According to positive psychology, appreciating the positives in our lives can improve happiness and meaning.
 
With CBT Thought Diary, you can gradually change your approach to how you interpret the ups and downs of life, making long-lasting changes in your mental well-being.

According to positive psychology, practicing gratitude and recording positive emotions is important as well. Thought Diary also allows you to keep track of your positive experiences so that you can refer back to them and appreciate the good moments, as well as note down what particular things you're grateful for. This way, you can be more aware and thankful of the positive moments in life.

Thought Diary will help you evaluate, understand, and change your thoughts and feelings. By using this application, you can work to identify your emotions, analyze how and why you're feeling this way, challenge those negative beliefs, change your thinking patterns for future situations, and remember positive experiences. You can use this app as a mood journal, a thought record journal, and a gratitude journal.

Thought Records and Gratitude Journals similar to this app are commonly used in paper form in traditional cognitive-behavioral therapy for a variety of mental health disorders such as clinical depression and anxiety. If you are suffering from a mental health disorder, please consult a mental health professional or healthcare provider.

Our skilled online therapists are able to assist you in this way, just as if you were both in the same room. Wherever you may be located, a therapist is prepared to come chat with you and offer assistance. Just for this, we've created a special chat interface, which will let you communicate without restriction via voice or chat with high quality and get therapy that could help you feel good.

<h3>You have the path to happiness in front of you; it consists of these easy steps:<h3>

<h3>Qualified therapists, easy to use</h3>
Online counseling is a great deal simpler than traditional treatment done in-person: you are immediately paired with a real therapist who specializes in your needs; and if you don't like them, changing advisers is as simple as clicking a few buttons. No more circling different therapists' offices in search of the ideal one, and no more trying out several sessions of getting mental health help before you find the right one.
Every single one of our therapists is legally licensed to practice therapy, counseling or psychology by their state board. You will undoubtedly discover a good fit with a counselor, since their fields of expertise and level of experience vary. We have therapists who specialize in treating people with depressive disorders, addictions, couples who need some therapy and anxiety disorders. Some of our therapists are also members of the LGBTQ+ community, and many of them have additional training in treating LGBTQ+ people. In addition, if you prefer, you can be paired with one of our more spiritual or religious therapists.

<h3>Keep your personal counseling life private</h3>
You don't have to tell anyone that you're using online therapy. You may communicate privately and anonymously with your live therapist at any time. Therefore – unless you want them to – no one has to know that you’re facing your demons. In this regard, if you’re struggling with social anxiety, the battle becomes especially easy when you use online therapy since chat and text are less socially-demanding than once a week in-person sessions.</h3></h3>","1,000+",4.8333335,Lifestyle,USD,0.0,True

<b>Accessibility Service</b>

The app features a series of alarm tasks called CAPCTHA which make sure you do not oversleep. Completing tasks like sheep counting, math equations or scanning a bar-code on your toothpaste will make sure you are fully awake and ready for your morning.

To make sure you won\'t sleep through your duties the app may use an Accessibility Service to prevent you from force stopping the app or turning off the device (cheating) before completing the alarm tasks (CAPTCHA). No private information are collected.

<b>Device Admin</b> 

This app may use the Device Administrator permission.
The reason is effective CAPTCHA (a feature to make sure you wake up in the morning) so you cannot avoid alarms by uninstalling the app during an alarm.

<h2><b>★★★★★  Slumber is Better for sleep than the Calm app</b></h2>
I bought <b>Slumber & Calm</b> at the same time. When I want help sleeping, I find myself turning to Slumber only. Their narrators are more skilled in the hypnotic, soothing style of speaking. You don't need celebrities; you need people with wonderful voices who know how to read in a hypnotherapy-style cadence. And Slumber has <b>better sleep sound options</b>, and you have more control over those options. I also like that you can choose to keep playing the background music, and perhaps a sound like rain, for a set amount of time after the narration ends. Also— <b>better calm stories designed for relaxing, comforting sleep</b> too! Plus, the <b>price is better</b>.

Curing insomnia is not only about sounds to help you sleep. Sleeping meditation, stories for sleep & doctor-prescribed sleep aids can also help. Our goal is to help you through the journey of getting a good night's sleep. Our bedtime app does not provide sleep games that make you sleepy.

These stages progress cyclically from 1 through REM then begin again with stage 1. A complete sleep cycle takes an average of 90 to 110 minutes, with each stage lasting between 5 to 25 minutes.
 
Sleep Monitor uses both microphone and accelerator sensors to measure body movements and environmental noise changes and then recognize your sleep stages.

Sleep Monitor will generate useful information for you after tracking, like sleep score, sleep cycle graphic, sleep statistics, sleep noise audios. Get your daily, weekly, or monthly sleep insights and use those data to help you sleep better.

<b>Avrora</b> is based on the only extremely effective 🚀drug-free 🙅‍♀️ option for overcoming sleeping problems. Unlike sleeping pills, it helps to eliminate the underlying causes of sleeping problems and develop better sleep habits✨. 

⭐️ <b>HOW AVRORA WORKS</b>

⭐️ <b>Falling asleep:</b>
Deep calm breathing leads to the predominance of the processes of inhibition in the central nervous system. It allows to regulate pressure and heartbeat, focus attention on breathing, thereby distracting from unwanted thoughts. Deep and controlled breathing is evolutionarily associated with a feeling of rest and relaxation. In addition, soothing sounds provide an opportunity to relax and get a positive emotion, effectively reducing the likelihood of excitation before sleep. 

⭐️ <b>Sleep retention:</b>
Breathing technique results in more reliable replacement of wakefulness rhythms (alpha and beta waves) with low-amplitude sleep waves (theta and delta waves), thus making sleep much more durable. Meditation sessions promote deep relaxation, bring the body to a deep and lasting sleep. Bedtime meditation qualitatively improves the most fragile REM phase, which allows you to complete a full sleep cycle and feel yourself full of energy in the morning.

⭐️ <b>Awakening:</b>
After a good deep sleep your body is restored and is ready to function in full. <b>Smart alarm</b> analyzes your sleeping schedule and wakes you up gently from the lightest phase in your sleep cycle. Pleasant alarm melodies allow you to wake up gently, gradually and with no stress. It is very important to live the first minutes of your day with positive emotions and thoughts.  

⭐️ <b>WHY DO YOU NEED AVRORA?</b>

Ask yourself the following questions: 
❓ Do you face difficulty getting to sleep or staying asleep?
❓ Do you feel tired in the morning right after you wake up? 
❓ Do you have difficulty concentrating during the day?
❓ Are you struggling to stay organized? 
❓ Do you feel so tired that all you can think about is sleep?
If you answered yes to any of these questions, then you can definitely benefit from using <b>Avrora</b> app for sleep and well-being improvement. Download <b>Avrora</b> and enjoy your perfect sleeping experience.

Sleep issues,Loóna: Bedtime Calm & Relax,https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/fffXLFDPFWTMOOccVhKXhgoMplRzMAcJDsklCrSjbaLPoMEIiWhq8m6T9uk4PEGC0Q,"- WHAT IS LOÓNA?
loóna is the first app that lets you quickly disconnect from a long stressful day and get in the right mood to sleep soundly. 
 
- SO, IT'S ANOTHER APP TO HELP YOU SLEEP WELL, RIGHT?
Not exactly. Loóna isn’t a list of direct go-to-sleep techniques, but rather a mood-altering app that helps you to stay calm during the day and prepares you emotionally to fall asleep easily in the evening.
 
- WHY IS BEDTIME MOOD IMPORTANT?
Negative emotions we accumulate during the day are processed and consolidated by our brain during sleep making them more difficult to disassociate from when faced again in the future. Moreover, feeling angry, anxious, down, or, the opposite, excited, and elated, is likely to affect latencies to sleep onset and REM-sleep. People mistake it for the symptoms of a sleep disorder, but in reality, they just may be in the wrong mood to sleep well.
 
- HOW DOES LOÓNA WORK?
From the wake up and during the busy day Loóna will support your emotional states with playlists and immersive stories. Each night you’ll have a recommended sleepscape. A sleepscape is a guided session that bundles together  CBT, activity-based relaxation, storytelling and sleep sounds in a unique way. Complete it to shut the frantic world out,relieve anxiety, reset your mind, and create the perfect mood for sleep.  Focus on calming activities and quiet your racing thoughts.

- IS IT DIFFERENT FROM SLEEP MEDITATION?

Mastering sleep meditation techniques require a lot of patience and time. Starting your Loóna journey is as easy as playing a relaxing game for just 15 minutes a day.

What do you get:
- 70+ interactive sleepscape journeys
- immersive bedtime stories
- music to relax, calm down or focus
- nature sounds including rain sounds and ocean waves, wind or white noise for tinnitus relief
- lullabies to help you put your kids to bed
- breathing exercises
- gentle alarm clock
- affirmations and motivational quotes

Does your newborn baby wake up in the middle of the night? We've got you covered! From white noise to nature sounds and everything in between, our sounds are made to help you focus, relax, and sleep better. There are numerous benefits to using white noise:

• Helps you sleep by blocking distractions
• Relaxes and reduces stress
• Pacifies fussy and crying babies
• Increases focus while enhancing privacy
• Soothes headaches and migraines
• Masks tinnitus (ringing of the ears)

Even when you’re asleep, your brain is constantly scanning and listening for sounds. If it’s too quiet, unwanted noises such as faucet drips or police sirens can interrupt your sleep. White Noise generates sounds over a wide range of frequencies, masking those noise interruptions, so you can not only fall asleep, but stay asleep.

Commonly misunderstood as an annoying personality quirk, OCD usually involves intense distress and can become completely debilitating.

IS NOCD THERAPY EFFECTIVE?

WHO ARE THE NOCD THERAPISTS?

NOCD therapists include licensed counselors, psychologists, and social workers, and they all are trained in exposure and response prevention, or ERP, the most effective OCD treatment. All NOCD therapists are managed by our clinical leadership team, who have 20+ years experience treating OCD and have designed some of the world’s top OCD treatment programs.

In a virtual setting designed to put you at ease, this app complements the aid received from your specialist. It takes therapy out of the confines of a therapist’s office.

With a user-friendly interface and a simple, functional design, the app provides a platform for you to manage your OCD in an effective way. The physical features of the app, designed entirely by 14-20-year-old students, allow for a graphic and interactive experience for the users, thus creating a space to easily fight compulsions.

The app helps you learn more about OCD, providing information about the causes and types of OCD and methods to combat it. It offers features to track your compulsions, building an environment suitable to control their OCD. Controlling OCD for the long-term is done using various ways to resist and weaken compulsions.

1. Scheduling your Worry Time - You can schedule specific periods of worry, which will, in the long run, reduce the time spent performing compulsions.

2. Controlling your Compulsions - You can also manipulate their compulsions, including changing them (their frequency and order), postponing them (offering mild resistance), shortening/retarding them (effectively minimizing their effect on your life).

3. Creating a Fear Ladder - The app also allows you to create their own Fear Ladder of triggers for each of your compulsions, and perform exposure exercises to normalize these triggers. You can perform CBT exercises on the app, which helps analyze your thought processes.

4. Setting Goals for yourself - All these exercises can be planned using our Goal-Setting feature. Using this, you can set short-term, medium-term and long-term goals, thus motivating yourself to fight your anxiety.

5. Connecting with your Therapist through regular Reports  - The app sends weekly progress reports to your therapist with data it collects automatically through your exercises. These reports include data regarding the effect of your compulsions on your emotions, the number of OCD attacks you suffered over the week (also relating your compulsions to the time of day), and various triggers and calming factors specific to each compulsion. The app also allows the scheduling of the OCI-R between certain intervals of time, to measure the severity of your compulsions. The report also covers data regarding anxiety levels experienced by the user during their exposure exercises as well as the status of homework assignments given to them by their therapist.

6. Getting External Support - You will also be able to designate certain support members whom you trust, who will be notified when you suffer an attack or have multiple compulsions and other situations where external help is critical. This ensures that you are not alone in your journey to conquer your OCD.

Liberate: My OCD Fighter is an all-in-one app that connects your compulsions, obsessions, personal goals and thoughts to your specialist-advised therapy. It makes for a planned resolution of your anxieties and is designed to generate more positive thoughts and emotions.

Everyone has worried about germs or losing something or someone getting hurt. These thoughts tend to be fleeting and do not disrupt daily living. If these thoughts are constantly occurring, uncontrollable, intrusive, and cause a lot of anxiety or stress, then they may be considered 'obsessions.'

Everyone has felt the need to double check that the door is locked or arrange items in a correct way. If you perform these actions like a ritual or with rigid rules in order to prevent or reduce anxious thoughts, or if these actions greatly disrupt your life, then they may be considered 'compulsions.'

This app is designed to evaluate your symptoms of OCD with a scientifically-supported 18-question test. It uses the Obsessive-Compulsive Inventory - Revised (OCI-R), a screening questionnaire for OCD that is commonly used in research and healthcare settings. The OCI-R is also helpful for monitoring your OCD-related symptoms during and after treatment.

OCD Test contains four tools:
- Start Test: take the OCI-R questionnaire to assess OCD symptoms
- History: see a history of your test scores to monitor your symptoms over time
- Information: learn about OCD and discover additional resources that can help you on your path to recovery
- Reminder: set up notifications to re-take the questionnaire at your convenience

Disclaimer: The OCI-R is NOT a diagnostic test. A diagnosis can only be provided by a qualified healthcare professional. Please consult a physician or mental health professional if you are concerned about OCD.

CBT Thought Diary is a journal with a purpose: it uses effective tools from Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT), Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT), Dialectical Behavioral Therapy (DBT), and Positive Psychology to help improve your mood.

Do you feel like you're always stressed, anxious, sad, frustrated, or unmotivated? The centerpiece of cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) is learning to identify negative and distorted thinking patterns to change your emotions and your behaviors for the better. In CBT, a ""thought record"" guides you through the steps of identifying, challenging, and reinterpreting negative thinking patterns. With Thought Diary, you can document your negative emotions, analyze flaws in your thinking, and re-evaluate your negative thoughts into more balanced ones. It may even help you recognize helpful ways to deal with your negative behaviors and emotions for future situations.

CBT Thought Diary can do more than thought records, though! It can also be used as a daily mood tracker. You can even practice gratitude by creating positive entries using our flexible diary entry format. According to positive psychology, appreciating the positives in our lives can improve happiness and meaning.
 
With CBT Thought Diary, you can gradually change your approach to how you interpret the ups and downs of life, making long-lasting changes in your mental well-being.

According to positive psychology, practicing gratitude and recording positive emotions is important as well. Thought Diary also allows you to keep track of your positive experiences so that you can refer back to them and appreciate the good moments, as well as note down what particular things you're grateful for. This way, you can be more aware and thankful of the positive moments in life.

Thought Diary will help you evaluate, understand, and change your thoughts and feelings. By using this application, you can work to identify your emotions, analyze how and why you're feeling this way, challenge those negative beliefs, change your thinking patterns for future situations, and remember positive experiences. You can use this app as a mood journal, a thought record journal, and a gratitude journal.

Thought Records and Gratitude Journals similar to this app are commonly used in paper form in traditional cognitive-behavioral therapy for a variety of mental health disorders such as clinical depression and anxiety. If you are suffering from a mental health disorder, please consult a mental health professional or healthcare provider.

By establishing the baseline, you can conduct behavioral self-experiments by gradually reducing the number of performed compulsions. Goal 0/0 helps you run the experiments and can be used as a companion product for therapy.

While you can use it in any way it helps you when dealing with checking compulsions, we recommend the following:

1) Save the checking compulsions you perform most frequently (e.g., that the main entrance is locked).

2) Log each performed compulsion one by one during the OCD episode to establish a baseline.

3) Stay at or below the number of performed checking compulsions established with the baseline.

4) Conduct behavioral self-experiments by gradually reducing the number of performed checking compulsions during an OCD episode.

5) Notice any changes in behavior.

Playing this amazing game with energy can increase your mental focus and relax you at the same time.

<b>Features:</b>
<b>Simple gameplay:</b> Just tap the lines to rotate and create connected loops. The wires will shine when at least one bolt and a lamp are connected through a line. 
<b>Relaxing:</b> People with OCD issues mention this game as a great way to get better. Energy gameplay is very calm – “just tap the line” – and a couple of levels per day are enough to fight OCD and anxiety issues. It’s like practicing yoga with your smartphone.
<b>Smart brain-teasers:</b> Energy features endless minimalist brain-teasers that will boost your logic skills, relax your soul and improve your concentration. It will make you bright!
<b>Classic game:</b> Highly compared with other logic games due to its simplicity, Energy is very satisfying and will illuminate the creative side of your brain. 
<b>Play everywhere:</b> You will take less than 20 seconds to illuminate a circuit. That’s perfect to play on the bus or while you wait for your flight at the airport. Start playing and relax wherever you are!
<b>Recharge your battery:</b> If your body battery is very low, Energy is the way to recharge it. Wherever you are at the airport, on the train, or on the bus, boost your concentration and make your brain shine with the brain-teasers reminiscent of Infinity Loop.

Better than a yoga session, Energy will relax your soul!
Play the king of logic games now!

If your body battery is fading, Energy is the perfect boost to recharge it! Featuring a minimalist style, a transmission circuit, and smart brain-teasers, this bright game will help you to calm your anxiety and get your concentration in line!

Energy is reminiscent of the classic Loop by its simplicity and satisfaction provided. You just need to tap the wire to rotate it and manage to connect all the lines. Make sure the transmission includes at least a lamp circle, a wire, and a lightning bolt circle to illuminate the light circuit. The wire loops will shine when everything is connected! 

Part of the famous Infinity Loop franchise, this calm, minimalist, and smart game will help you dealing with anxiety and OCD. Instead of closing endless loops, you must tap to connect every wire to the lamp and create a closed light transmission. Once you tap the first line, you will boost your concentration and reduce any symptoms of anxiety or OCD. Try to illuminate the circuit as many times as you can and recharge your soul with positive ideas. 

In calm brain-teasers like this, you don’t need to be super smart or fast as a lightning bolt to succeed. Creating a functional light circle using every wire, bolt, and lamp is more important than delivering a bright performance. ENERGY environment is satisfying and minimalist, featuring a calm soundtrack and endless light loops. The positive energy provided by this game will recharge your smartphone battery or make your brain shine like a star.

If you are looking for a minimalist tap game to boost your concentration, ENERGY is the right choice. Like other easy-to-learn logic games, this smart game features endless brain-teasers and its structure works as a circle: since you can’t finish it, your progress is like an endless circle. 

Working as a concentration boost and a great way of fighting anxiety and OCD issues, Energy is also a fun way of improving creativity while you relax your soul. By connecting every wire, lamp, and bolt, you will illuminate the transmission and create bright light shapes.

We associate ENERGY with yoga because this game is an excellent way to purify your mind and soul When you complete a dozen levels, your heart rate slows down. Just like in a yoga exercise.

<b>Intended medical purpose</b>

The MindDoc monitoring and self-management application medical device provides continuous long-term sign and symptom monitoring of common mental disorders. This protocol is supplemented by courses and exercises. This enables users to recognize patterns in their symptom trajectories which then can be shared with a mental health care provider and used for self-management. MindDoc thus

provides users orientation regarding the need to consult a mental health care provider by providing an assessment of the general emotional health. A mental health care provider then can include the summary of the protocols in his overall diagnostic and clinical assessment.

enables users to self-manage symptoms and related problems by providing both transdiagnostic and disorder-specific evidence-based courses and exercises which help them to recognize, understand, and cope with signs and symptoms of mental disorders by self-initiating behaviour change.

<b>Important Note</b>
The application explicitly does not replace the diagnosis by a mental health care provider, but can only give orientation on whether to consult a mental health care provider who then can include the results of the medical device in diagnostic processes. The application explicitly does not replace psychotherapy.

A <b>therapy app</b> that goes beyond traditional <b>mindfulness practices</b> to address what you're feeling in the moment.

Even a few minutes of being's <b>Music Therapy</b> enables <b>anxiety relief.</b> ✨

Some <b>mental health apps</b> deliver <b>meditation</b> or mindfulness advice.

And some people may shame you for talking about your emotions (or ask you to “go take a walk”)

But not <b>being</b>.

<b>being</b> recognizes that <b>mental health</b> is a continuous and lifelong journey.

And when it comes to <b>coping</b> with <b>anxiety and depression,</b>

The disorders include anorexia nervosa (voluntary starvation), bulimia nervosa (binge-eating followed by purging), binge-eating disorder (binge-eating without purging), and unspecified eating disorders (disordered eating that does not fit into another category).

Eating disorders occur frequently—but not exclusively—in affluent cultures. A disproportionate number of those diagnosed are young women in their teens and 20s, but anyone, including young men and older adults, can develop an eating disorder at any age. Among the most baffling of conditions, eating disorders take on a life of their own so that eating, or not eating, becomes the focus of everyday existence.

Biological factors, social pressure, and family history and dynamics are some of the factors associated with eating disorders. Culturally mediated body-image concerns and personality traits like perfectionism and obsessiveness also play a large role in eating disorders, which are often accompanied by depression and/or anxiety.

Treatment is never simple for these conditions. They often create multiple medical problems and can even be acutely life-threatening, requiring hospitalization and forced nourishment. It can take a multidisciplinary team of health professionals, including a psychotherapist, a medical doctor, and a specialized dietitian or nutritionist to bring about full recovery in someone with an eating disorder.

Eating disorders include having attitudes, beliefs, and behaviors about food and body image that arise from negative feelings associated with food.[1] Behaviors can range from restricting food intake, throwing up after meals, bingeing on foods, and compulsively overeating. If you are ready to treat an eating disorder, you probably are already aware that you struggle to have a healthy relationship with food. It can be hard to admit you have a problem, but it can be even harder to reach out and start treating it. Be aware that many others have worked through the emotional problems associated with eating disorders and you can, too.

With body image in our culture being on the forefront of our minds, it is no surprise that not people realize that this is a problem and can be highly addicting. Anorexia Nervosa Help Calendar can help you put an end to your anorexia addiction by holding you accountable, offering solutions, words of encouragement, and science based facts that will help you get past your anorexia nervosa.

1. Use our counter to track your progress down to the second.
2. Create your own reasons to quit anorexia, or use one of our scientifically based facts about quitting.
3. Change the look and feel of the app with our skins section to personalize the app to what you want.

8. Our motivational quotes and testimonials will ensure that you are not alone on this process to shake anorexia.
 
Anorexia is characterized by a distorted body image, with an unwarranted fear of being overweight. Symptoms include trying to maintain a below-normal weight through starvation or too much exercise. Medical treatment may be needed to restore normal weight. Download this free app to help you overcome. 
 
Here are our top 8 reasons to say no to anorexia:
 
1. Stop feeling isolated from others
 
It is not easy to explain to others why you aren’t eating. Anorexia keeps you in a bubble, and that cannot be a good thing. Social experience is a part of being human, and when you start isolating yourself for being anorexic, you experience emotional and physical pain.
 
2. Malnutrition is a big issue
 
Malnutrition happens when your body is deprived of essential calories and nutrients that you need to survive. The constant food restriction of anorexia makes your body malnourished and more prone to illnesses and disease.
 
3. Anorexic dehydration
 
Mild dehydration will cause dry skin, head rushes, chills, and weakness. More serious dehydration will lead to increased heart rate and heavier breathing. If you let it go any farther than this, you will be at risk for cardiac arrest, seizures, and even unconsciousness.
 
4. Anorexia makes you lose hair
 
The lack of nutrients entering your body forces your body to condense its functional responses. Anything that your body feels unnecessary for survival will start to get less nutrients. This starts with your hair. Your hair may thin or start falling out. 
 
5. Random thin hairs will start growing on your body
 
Your body must compensate for the lack of insulation that your body provides, so in a last ditch attempt to save your internal temperature; you will start growing thin hairs on your face and in other unwanted areas of the body.
 
6. Anorexia makes your fingernails brittle
 
This goes back to the lack of nutrition flowing through your body. Your fingernails are not an essential part of your body when you are not getting enough nutrients, so your body will shut down the flow of nutrients to your nails.
 
7. You could become infertile!
 
Body fat is essential for menstruation. Not only will you lose your ability to become pregnant, but you will also stop having your period. Some may see this as a perk, but extended periods of this will lead to permanent infertility. 
 
8. Bone loss
 
With anorexia, bones become more brittle because of the lack of nutrient delivery. This will lead to having weaker bones and increase the chances of your bones breaking.

Anorexia is an eating disorder that is characterized by extreme weight loss. People suffering from anorexia struggle to maintain a weight that is appropriate to age and height and could have a distorted body image.

Anorexia affects the body’s overall health in a dramatic and dangerous way. [1] According to the National Eating Disorder’s Association, you cannot tell that a person is suffering from anorexia just by looking at them. [2] Studies have shown that this eating disorder can occur in individuals across body types, age, gender, and ethnicity.

It is important to seek professional help to treat an eating disorder. Psychosocial support and participation in counseling are essential facets of treatment for anorexia nervosa. Effective home remedies can help in being a complementary and supportive technique for people with anorexia.

Are you experiencing unexplained weight loss? Are you afraid to gain weight and therefore you avoid meals? You might be suffering from Anorexia Nervosa. Anorexia Nervosa (or simply known as anorexia) is an eating disorder causing a severe weight loss. More than physical, it is a mental condition. The main symptoms of anorexia are fatigue, insomnia, low body weight, pale skin, hair loss, brittle nails, depression, dry skin, constipation, low blood pressure, chronic fatigue, frequent mood swings, avoiding social gatherings, etc. The biggest problem with the treatment of anorexia is that it is really difficult to diagnose and should not be confused with bulimia, a similar but distinct condition. And, it can cause serious physical disorders such as bone weight loss, anemia, imbalance of electrolytes in the body, kidney problems, etc., if it is not cured timely. It would be wise to consult a doctor and psychologists to treat this condition. However, some of the natural remedies can also be helpful to cure anorexia.",500+,0.0,Health & Fitness,USD,0.0,True

Shutterbite has all the tools that you need to start eating mindfully and intuitively to repair your relationship with food. 

Why is it that 90% of people who go on diets end up gaining all of their weight back? Because they do not build the eating habits they need to maintain a healthy relationship with food.

Our goal is to help you build eating habits that will help you build a healthy lifestyle without the pressure of dieting. It’s not about what you eat or how much you eat it is about why you eat and how that makes you feel. 

Shutterbite uses mindfulness and mindful eating to focus on creating sustainable change to your lifestyle. Mindfulness helps you to become aware of the current eating habits and behavior that you have. Awareness is the key to change.

With mindful eating, you learn to focus on unwanted behaviors and feelings that you have around food that keep you from being able to reach your goal. With a mindful eating approach Shutterbite helps you track why you are eating, how you feel after eating, and your hunger before and after eating. 

Whether you are a beginner in mindful eating or an expert Shutterbite is the best app for you to eat mindfully, eat intuitively, build better eating habits, and repair your relationship with food.

FULL DESCRIPTION:
Symptom to Diagnosis teaches you an evidence-based, step-by-step process for evaluating, diagnosing, and treating patients based on their clinical complaints. By applying this process, you will be able to recognize specific diseases and prescribe the most effective therapy.

Each chapter addresses one common complaint and begins with a case and guidance on how to organize the differential diagnosis. As the case progresses, clinical reasoning is explained in detail. The differential diagnosis for that particular case is summarized in tables that highlight the clinical clues and important testsfor the leading diagnostic hypothesis and alternative diagnostic hypotheses. As the chapter progresses, the pertinent diseases are reviewed. Just as in real life, the case unfolds in a stepwise fashion as tests are performed and diagnoses are confirmed or refuted.

The third edition is enhanced by the addition of five new chapters--Bleeding Disorders, Dysuria, Hematuria, Hypotension, and Sore Throat--as well as a greater emphasis on how to master the process of working from patient level data (signs, symptoms, and laboratory tests). All chapters incorporate the latest research resulting in new and refined approaches to common symptoms encountered in clinical medicine.","1,000+",4.0,Medical,USD,0.0,True

Diagnose is a novel medical app which aids clinicians in the diagnosis of common internal medicine conditions. The app allows users to incorporate validated findings from the history, physical examination and investigations to calculate an evidence-based likelihood of disease. This app is intended for use by internal medicine physicians and trainees, with the goal of improving patient care and medical education at the bedside. 

Diagnose provides you with an evidence-based pre-test probability, validated likelihood ratios and a calculated post-test probability based on your findings for over 45 of the most commonly seen conditions in internal medicine. The data is validated from sources (JAMA Rational Clinical Exam Series, etc).

When examining a patient with a presumptive diagnosis, such as stroke, physicians can now see in real-time how specific findings on the history, physical exam and laboratory evaluation of patients alters the likelihood of disease.

The primary objective of treatment is to ensure complete cure, that is the rapid and full elimination of the Plasmodium parasite from the patient’s blood, in order to prevent progression of uncomplicated malaria to severe disease or death, and to prevent chronic infection that leads to malaria-related anaemia.

From a public health perspective, the goal of treatment is to reduce transmission of the infection to others, by reducing the infectious reservoir, and to prevent the emergence and spread of resistance to antimalarial medicines.

Importance of diagnostic testing
Patients with suspected malaria should have parasitological confirmation of diagnosis with either microscopy or rapid diagnostic test (RDT) before antimalarial treatment is started. Treatment based on clinical grounds should only be given if diagnostic testing is not immediately accessible within 2 hours of patients presenting for treatment. Prompt treatment – within 24 hours of fever onset – with an effective and safe antimalarial is necessary to effect a cure and prevent life-threatening complications.

About three billion people are at risk of infection in 109 countries. Each year, there are an estimated 250 million cases of malaria leading to approximately one million deaths, mostly in children under five years of age. The organism that causes the most dangerous form of malaria is a microscopic parasite called Plasmodium falciparum.

This parasite is transmitted by mosquito species belonging to the Anopheles genus and only by females of those species.
There is growing international agreement on how best to use prevention and treatment methods that are available. The most effective prevention measures include the use of mosquito bed nets treated with long-lasting insecticides to avoid the mosquito bites and to kill the mosquitoes and spraying the inside walls of houses with similar insecticides to kill malaria-carrying mosquitoes. The most effective treatment for malaria consists in using a combination of several anti-malarial drugs, one of which is a derivative of artemisinin. Preventive treatment of pregnant women with anti-malarial drugs can also reduce the harmful effects of malaria both on the mother and on the unborn child.","1,000+",0.0,Medical,USD,0.0,True

It’s typically transmitted through the bite of an infected Anopheles mosquito. Infected mosquitoes carry the Plasmodium parasite. When this mosquito bites you, the parasite is released into your bloodstream. Once the parasites are inside your body, they travel to the liver, where they mature. After several days, the mature parasites enter the bloodstream and begin to infect red blood cells.

Malaria can occur if a mosquito infected with the Plasmodium parasite bites you. There are four kinds of malaria parasites that can infect humans: Plasmodium vivax, P. ovale, P. malariae, and P. falciparum.

""Feedback is one of the most powerful motivators for adhering to a healthy lifestyle. The Stroke Riskometer offers a state-of-the-art method of doing so. The fact that it is offered for free, makes it likely that it will be used widely. The stroke risk factors that it targets, if controlled, can contribute to reducing not only stroke but heart disease and perhaps even preventing or delaying dementia. May this application enjoy the wide use and evaluation that it deserves.""Distinguished University Professor Vladimir Hachinski, Western University, London, Ontario, Canada

Join the patients who have already seen remarkable results using our 6-week courses. Scientifically-backed exercises designed for you:

- Follow our personalized program
- Do easy yet effective challenges
- See results

You have enough to think about after having a stroke, that’s why Strokemark takes the guesswork out of what you should be doing to compliment your rehabilitation. Research shows that almost all stroke patients could do more than just their regular rehab, so we’ve come up with a plan that you can do at home in between your scheduled appointments. We want you to reach your full recovery potential.

Our scientifically-backed program supports you on your journey. Whether you’re a stroke survivor or caregiver, our app gives you a clear plan for each day and explains why the exercises are important. You’ll feel good knowing what you need to be doing and why it works.

In our testing phase, we offer two research-tested walking courses. They are free for a limited time while we are working on other courses. Give it a try and let us know what you think!

SCIENCE-BASED COURSES
Our team combs through thousands of scientific articles to see what’s new in the field of stroke rehabilitation. We take the relevant findings and build them into our plan. This way, you get the most out of every exercise.

Our courses are tested before we bring them to you. When there is evidence that a new course works, we make it available to you.

We also let you know why our program is structured the way it is. We don’t expect you to jump in without knowing why you are doing something. That’s why we provide you with the science behind our thinking. We offer you a selection of articles that highlight the findings we came across in our research and explain how they relate to the course.

PERSONALIZED APPROACH
Every stroke is different and each patient has a different functional level afterward. That’s why our programs can be personalized. We start where you are. Our first order of business is to assess your current level so that we can adjust your plan. From there, we set your goals and accompany you along the way.

EXERCISE AT HOME
Many patients tell us that they want to do more for their recovery, but they just aren’t sure what will work in addition to their regular rehab. Strokemark gives you a clear plan of what to do each day. No need to wait until your next appointment to get some instructions.

We offer clearly structured, easy-to-follow, 6-week courses to help you along your way. You’ll receive simple instructions about what and how much to do every day. When you do it is up to you – that’s the luxury of having exercises you can do at home.

IMPROVE YOUR WALKING
Being able to walk steadily and surely leads to greater independence. Not only that, studies show that the more active you are, the more you reduce your risk of another stroke. That’s why our first course focuses on improving your walking. We start with walking further and faster. Then we incorporate strength exercises, focus training, and nutrition tips to support your progress.

Stroke prevention,Strocit :Post stroke exercises,https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/grwpGpsGV1DZgG_tugQGT4A1ShdinmrVfEkAepTM04AmpOnZoWeob_7AtWOirIvczQSw,"Moving around safely and easily may not be something you think about, unless you’ve had a stroke. Many stroke survivors have trouble moving around. These problems range from balance issues to arm or leg paralysis. As a result, about 40 percent of stroke survivors have serious falls within a year of their strokes. But, there is good news. Rehab therapy along with regular exercise may improve your balance and ability to move.
The most common physical effect of stroke is muscle weakness. Survivors often work with therapists to restore muscle strength through exercise programs. They also learn skills to deal with the loss of certain body movements.
The post stroke exercise mobile app illustrates exercise programs 
adapted from National Stroke Association. The app features exercises in video animation format along with easy to follow steps, thus offers an unique experience and excellent visual communication tool. Moreover these exercises are presented in 11 regional languages.

There are two exercise programs illustrated in the apps. The first is for the person whose physical abilities have been mildly affected by the stroke. The second is for those with greater limitations. If you are not sure which one is appropriate, consult the profile that precedes each program.
As with any exercise program, consult with your doctor and/or therapist before beginning this program. If any exercises are too difficult and cause pain or increase stiffness in your limbs, do not do them.","10,000+",4.2,Education,USD,0.0,True
Stroke prevention,Hope After Stroke,https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/AIRFgqjQk0oSNlfOE9CaQvbUI3vSULHA-Wvn-XfYa5KO5-ibmRdoE_eiN75Qv-_CtA,"Every stroke patient is unique. And considering the fact every patient presents
with different cocktail of challenges, the onus lies on the
physiotherapist/assistant to thoroughly undertake a comprehensive assessment
of each patient taking into cognizance the patient's needs as articulated by the
patient himself or herself.

After a thorough assessment has been undertaken, the goals and treatment
protocol become easy to draft. Remember that all the goals that are drafted in
stroke rehabilitation must be aimed towards the integration of the patient back
into the social set up. And this is a very critical and important goal: so vital that
no Rehabilitation approach could overlook, just as the psychosocial module of
healthcare practice stipulates.

On the contrary, the medical model of healthcare practice primarily focuses on the
patient's clinical condition outside his social environment. Although this
healthcare approach also yields results clinically, it however fails to integrate the
patient back into the society or family. That explicitly explains my preference for
the psychosocial model of rehabilitation over the medical model during my
patients’ Rehabilitation.

Essence of this App:
The publication of this self-help handbook is intended to serve the long sought
after dream of enlightening stroke patients on their condition and also assisting
them to quick recovery. Moreover, it is my fervent hope that the book would help
to ignite the burning desire in stroke care among Physiotherapist Assistants (in
both Orthodox and Herbal Centres) to embrace evidence-based practice and
appreciate new trends in stroke care through simple illustrative diagrams and
pictures.

In light of the recent rise in the prevalence of stroke attacks among the youthful
population, it is my desire that the information provided here would assist in
alerting the youth also on the need for a healthier lifestyle change.","5,000+",4.3333335,Health & Fitness,USD,0.0,True

It is a way to tell if someone is having a large artery stroke. Large artery stroke types tend to have worse outcomes and disable people. They are best treated with the additional use of Neurointerventional clot retrieval. Using VAN can assist people in getting loved ones in a center that performs these procedures, in turn giving them the best possible chance of functioning independently.

What Does VAN Stand For?

Vision – Can someone see to the left, right, up and down?
Aphasia – Medical term for understanding language and producing language.
Neglect – When some one looks to one side and ignores the other side. They usual have eyes looking to left or right.

Why Was it Developed?

There are other large artery stroke / large vessel occlusion (LVO) screening tools but some are longer, some are less accurate, and some over estimate the number of people that actually have a large clot. We had a genuine desire to get patients that have a massive stroke to the appropriate care faster.

A risk factor for stroke is high blood pressure.If you already have hypertension, you should take your medications on a regular basis and have your blood pressure checked on a regular basis to keep it at a healthy level.It will be helpful to have a monitoring device at home for checking the pressure.

Taking 81 milligrams of baby aspirin, a blood thinner, will maintain optimal blood flow and prevent strokes.A higher dose may be prescribed if the patient already suffers from a medical condition.

The mental and psychological state will improve, as will the ability to manage high levels of stress and eliminate depression, both of which will help to prevent strokes.Socializing, meditating, doing yoga, listening to music, and avoiding alcohol and caffeine are all beneficial.

Stroke risk is raised by smoking.Additionally, passive smokers have a 30% increased risk.Walking after meals, chewing gum, putting a toothpick in the mouth, and other similar activities can help a person quit smoking and reduce their desire to smoke.Severe addicts may benefit from seeking therapy.

Stroke risk is also increased by high levels of LDL.Whole grain, vegetables, lean meat, fish, and low-fat dairy products should all be a big part of a healthy diet that is low in bad cholesterol.Medications should be taken if the levels cannot be controlled through diet alone.

See sample output for a patient simulation.

THERE IS A LOT OF DATA TO CONSIDER BEFORE YOU MAKE YOUR DECISIONS

[LINK EACH OF THIS TO PAGE OF THIS NAME TO OPEN IN NEW TAB]
Exclusion criteria for 4.5 hr IV TPA  
Exclusions for 6 hour endovascular window
Exclusions under the 6-16 hour DEFUSE 3 criteria
Exclusions under the 6-24 hour DAWN criteria 

The truth of the matter is that much of this can get overlooked in an acute stroke situation. The objective of the stroke simulator is to make sure everything is factored into the decisions you make.

WHAT THE STROKE SIMULATOR DOES FOR YOU

Once you start up the STROKE SIM application, it enables rapid entry of clinical data , without fumbling around with google and stacks of paper and clumsy clunky EMRs . NIHSS documentation and scoring is in record time, test it out. ASPECTS scoring is a thing of beauty on the STROKE SIM, you are presented with a clickable brain image that rapidly calculates the score without holding up things. Inclusion and Exclusion criteria force you to review every point that MUST be reviewed, without glossing over or missing things or assuming things that should not be assumed. CT, CTA, CT perfusion studies, Labs, Modified Ranklin, current expectancy of life, everything that matters is factored in, without wasting time or holding you up. There are things that can be answered 'not done' and critical things that must be done that you cannot get past. 


THE EDUCATIONAL VALUE OF STROKE SIMULATOR:

If criteria are not met, it states clearly the logic and rationale of WHY CRITERIA HAVE NOT BEEN MET and again it addresseses the 4.5 hr IV TPA window, the 6 hour endovascular window, the 6-16 hour endovascular window and the 6-24 hour endovascular window.

Where you can learn heart works and living with heart conditions. The warning sign of heart problem and knowing the risk of heart disease is the first step of avoiding from heart attack or stroke. The information of the Heart disease is Heart disease describes a range of conditions that affect the heart. Diseases under heart disease include blood vessel diseases, such as coronary artery disease is heart rhythm problems (arrhythmias); and heart defects you're born with (congenital heart defects), among others.

The term ""heart disease"" is often used interchangeably with the term ""cardiovascular disease."" Cardiovascular disease generally refers to conditions that involve narrowed or blocked blood vessels that can lead to a heart attack, chest pain (angina) or stroke. Other heart conditions, such as those that affect your heart's muscle, valves or rhythm, also are considered forms of heart disease.

Cardiovascular disease symptoms may be different for men and women. For instance, men are more likely to have chest pain; women are more likely to have other symptoms along with chest discomfort, such as shortness of breath, nausea and extreme fatigue. 
Symptoms can include:

1.	Chest pain, chest tightness, chest pressure and chest discomfort (angina)
2.	Shortness of breath
3.	Pain, numbness, weakness or coldness in your legs or arms if the blood vessels in 
        those parts of your body are narrowed
4.	Pain in the neck, jaw, throat, upper abdomen or back
5.	Chest pain, chest tightness, chest pressure and chest discomfort (angina)
6.	Shortness of breath
7.	Pain, numbness, weakness or coldness in your legs or arms if the blood vessels in 
        those parts of your body are narrowed
8.	Pain in the neck, jaw, throat, upper abdomen or back
        Risk factors
•	Age. Aging increases your risk of damaged and narrowed arteries and weakened or 
        thickened heart muscle.
•	Sex. Men are generally at greater risk of heart disease. However, women's risk 
        increases after menopause.
•	Family history. A family history of heart disease increases your risk of coronary artery 
        disease, especially if a parent developed it at an early age 
•	Smoking. Nicotine constricts your blood vessels, and carbon monoxide can damage 
        their inner lining, making them more susceptible to atherosclerosis. Heart attacks are 
        more common in smokers than in nonsmokers.
•	High blood pressure. Uncontrolled high blood pressure can result in hardening and 
        thickening of your arteries, narrowing the vessels through which blood flows.
•	High blood cholesterol levels. High levels of cholesterol in your blood can increase the 
        risk of formation of plaques and atherosclerosis.
•	Diabetes. Diabetes increases your risk of heart disease. Both conditions share similar 
        risk factors, such as obesity and high blood pressure.
•	Obesity. Excess weight typically worsens other risk factors which diet that's high in 
        fat, salt, sugar and cholesterol can contribute to the development of heart disease.
•	Physical inactivity. Lack of exercise also is associated with many forms of heart 
        disease and some of its other risk factors, as well.
•	Stress. Unrelieved stress may damage your arteries and worsen other risk factors for 
        heart disease.

Complications

•	Heart failure. 
•	Heart attack.
•	Stroke. 
•	Aneurysm.

This FREE app is a cardiovascular risk calculator that estimates the possible 10-year risk of myocardial infarction, stroke, or cardiovascular death. It includes the six regions of the Americas (Andean, Caribbean, Central, North, South, and Tropical) according to tables published in 2019 by the World Health Organization (WHO) (Lancet, 2019). This risk score was based on extensive review of available cohorts and were adapted to 21 global regions based on analysis of the burden of cardiovascular morbidity. For each region, an estimate was published that requires knowing an individual's blood cholesterol level (or other information if the blood cholesterol level is not known). The Pan American Health Organization (PAHO), with the financial contribution of the U.S Centers for Diseases Prevention and Control, transformed the published color-coded tables into an online electronic calculator for use on computers and smartphones, updating the previous Cardiocal app (2014)


Who is this app for?

The calculator is intended to help the health care providers quickly calculate cardiovascular risk and discuss with patients the extent to which their risk can be reduced. It also aims to help people concerned about their health, making it easier for them to estimate the need for a medical consultation when their risk is not low. The treatment recommendations are oriented to the assisting professionals and do not constitute a guide to self-medication, which can be dangerous. Under no circumstances is this calculator intended as a replacement for medical consultation or a clinical judgment.

Features

» Click on the gear icon to choose a country. Each country belongs to one of the six regions mentioned above, and the risk calculation will give different results.

» You can change the language (English, Spanish, or Portuguese), cholesterol unit (mmol/L or mg/dl), and metric or imperial units (cm or feet and inches).

» The app includes country-specific protocols for the 12 countries whose health ministries have defined standardized protocols for the treatment of hypertension.","50,000+",3.8235295,Medical,USD,0.0,True

There is nothing more important to human health than the heart.

Seismocardiography (SCG) is a technique of measuring the vibrations produced by the beating heart, where those vibrations are recorded from the chest. HeartScan app uses your smartphone's embedded accelerometer and gyroscope to record your SCG. After the recording, the app uses advanced mathematical algorithms to analyze your SCG and extract information about your heart.

Using the app is fast and easy. Simply lay flat on your back, otherwise known as the supine position, start the app, and place the phone on your chest. Wait 1 minute for the data to be collected and check the results right there onscreen.

What does the app measure and present?

• An SCG chart with all recorded cardiac cycles. A cardiac cycle is a full process from the beginning of one heartbeat to the beginning of the next. The length of time between successful heartbeats can vary by up to 20%, but if the differences are longer or erratic, you may need to investigate this further.
• Heart rate. You can use the HeartScan app as a resting heart rate monitor, and get a very accurate measure of the heart rate. This is much more meticulous than pulsometer apps that rely on the phone's camera and finger for a pulse – HeartScan goes right to the ""heart"" of the matter.
• Length of each recorded cardiac cycle, which makes it possible to use the app as an hrv monitor.
• Distribution of the lengths of all recorded cardiac cycles.
• Combined cardiac cycle.
• Clear signs of abnormalities that may need attention and further detection by a healthcare professional.

You can save your measurements and view them later using the history section of the app so you can track and monitor your progress over time.

Heart attack prevention,The Heart App ©,https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/X_CS9IaTlgrRJwooTIwCdaj-hYTNroi0a1HT7KE1MvOPpmKuFIn-qJNh6lCoQ9eX1zqS,"The Heart App© on a mission to reduce fatalities due to heart diseases.

The Heart App© aims to help people find out if they are at risk of, or are developing a heart attack based on some questions regarding their seemingly serious or not so serious chest complaints. These questions try to mimic the sequential procedure that heart-specialists follow while diagnosing a patient. The Heart App© can also be of use to paramedical staff operating in field.

A majority of patients get some warning symptoms before a full-blown heart attack occurs, and if they are provided appropriate treatment in time, heart attack can even be avoided! It is these avoidable fatalities that we hope to stop with the help of the heart app©. A critical step in this direction is the information about heart attacks and coronary artery disease packed in the app in practical and easy to read compartments. The Heart App© would not only improves people’s awareness but also provide them a ready reference in their time of need.

Ample amount of research categorically points out that mortality and morbidity due to heart attack can be substantially prevented by two key methods- awareness and timely-treatment. Of the two key factors, timely treatment is a more concrete factor and if we could somehow equip people with accurate information via a pervasive medium then millions of lives can be saved. Probably The Heart App© can be of help here

At the time of heart attack every second is important since the damage to heart is time dependent. Maximum deaths occur due to abnormal heart beats.  These abnormal heart beats are due to electrical instability in the heart muscles which are dying due to heart attack.

The Heart App when utilized by nonmedical personnel helps bring medical attention to people at risk.

In this new version we have added the following:

INR Clinic-  
Warfarin and Acitrom are used to prolong the normal clotting time in human body and are known as anticoagulant. They are required to preventformation of unwanted blood clot or prevent progression of already formed blood clot.

Diseases where you need this drug

•   Metallic Prosthetic Heart Valves

•   Atrial fibrillation

•   Deep vein thrombosis

•   Pulmonary Embolism

Here user will know about the calculation of doses of warfarin or acitrom as per their PT-INR report. By using this app their record of INR will be maintained automatically and this will be of great help when they will visit their doctor for consultation. This digital way can help patients who are unable to connect with doctors frequently.

 
My records- 
In this section a person can maintain the record of his blood pressure and diabetes along with medication. Hypertension or high blood pressure and Diabetes are the most important risk factors for heart diseases and stroke. This record will help the physician in the management of these patients.

Here one can store his/her treatment related documents which will be very handy when they visit their doctors.

Diet & Exercise 
This section will provide relevant information regarding diet and exercise to live a healthy life

Health updates- 
In this part user will get relevant, useful, evidence based information regarding medical filed.
 
The Heart App is meant solely for the welfare of common man but we cannot do it without your help. We request you to share The Heart App© with your family & friends, and contribute to our small effort of fighting heart diseases which claim millions of innocent lives.

Please note that The Heart App©, by no means, intends to replace the clinical judgment of a doctor; rather its main purpose is to educate people, prevent them from ignoring an emergency and enable seeking early treatment.

Most people with coronary heart disease can feel healthy for years before they start experiencing symptoms. The most common symptom is a heart attack. If coronary heart disease is not treated, some of the plaques in the coronary arteries can break away and block the blood flow to the heart. Coronary heart disease is the most common cause of sudden death. It is also the most common cause of death in people over 65 years old. Men are 10 times more likely to get coronary heart disease than women.

Extensive clinical and statistical studies have identified several factors that increase the risk of coronary heart disease and heart attack

 Major risk factors are those that research has shown significantly increase the risk of heart and blood vessel (cardiovascular) disease.

About 82 percent of people who die of coronary heart disease are 65 or older. At older ages, women who have heart attacks are more likely than men are to die from them within a few weeks.

Men have a greater risk of heart attack than women do, and they have attacks earlier in life. Even after menopause, when women's death rate from heart disease increases,it's not as great as men's.

Therefore it is necessary to calculate the overall risk of the heart disease before its to late.

⏰Comprehensive Meds Reminder
CareClinic Pill Reminder is a medicine reminder software that meets all of your medication needs in one place: Pill reminders (e.g., for birth control pills), a complete medicines database, support for any dose form (incl. tablet, pill, inhalation, injection) frequency and even refill notifications. And since the program is not only a pill alarm but also a medication tracker, all you have to do is review its pill diary to confirm you took the important dose.

💊A Full Health & Well-being Tracker
We created CareClinic by collaborating with individuals who were taking medication. People with diabetes utilize the weight tracker in the app to measure their blood glucose levels and then record this data. The mood tracker also aids users in monitoring their mental health or any signs of depression. Using your blood pressure log, mood diary, or other parts of your customized health journal, assess how you're progressing. CareClinic's flexibility sets it apart from other applications; some people see it as a stroke app while others use it only for cancer care or weight tracking.


⏰ Trackers for Mood, Weight, Blood Pressure, Blood Oxygen, Blood Sugar and Other Measurements
The CareClinic mood diary, which lets you not only keep track of your medications but also your feelings and general well-being, is a fantastic addition. Take measurements such as blood pressure and weight. If you have diabetes and are on insulin therapy, you may use CareClinic to record blood glucose levels. Overall, CareClinic supports 500+ measurements. Users with multiple sclerosis, rheumatoid arthritis, or cardiovascular diseases like atrial fibrillation find the symptom tracker in the app useful.


💪Motivation to Take Your Meds
Atrial fibrillation, diabetes, rheumatoid arthritis, multiple sclerosis, anxiety or depression, and more can all be treated through CareClinic. The medication logger and health diary at CareClinic help you keep track of your development and remind you to take your medicine so you may enjoy a stress-free existence.

This is because in the daily hustle and bustle, things are simply forgotten, but the consequences can be dire…We bet you've definitely experienced this situation at least once in your life. 
Many people are used to using their alarm clock as a pill reminder - it rings at a certain time and you know exactly what time it is to take your pills. But it's a bygone era. Would you go to work or on a date with an alarm clock? Of course not! Or, for example, stickers or a notebook that you can always forget at home and miss your medication. It is much better and easier to keep a pill tracker in your smartphone. 
Taking medication is a big responsibility that affects how we feel and our health in general. And even classic reminders cannot perform their function to the best of their ability, the medication reminder is the best way to go about it.  
Timing is important when taking many medications, especially antibiotics, contraceptives, hormones and antivirals. Taking care of your health is an important part of your lifestyle, and the med tracker is a great addition to this.
In this medication alarm app you have many functions - you can enter your treatment course, create a personalized schedule, set reminders to take various medications and even monitor your body parameters (weight, height, temperature and so on). 
It's a real diary where you can keep track of your activities and changes! 
Using a medication tracker can not only improve your health status, it can also have a positive impact on the dynamics of the healthcare system. Such pill reminder and med tracker apps teach you how to be responsible, and this is a key step towards recovery!
The medicine reminder can be used as an indispensable aid in the treatment of chronic diseases, especially hypertension, diabetes, cardiovascular diseases and many others. For example, a person with diabetes will be able to keep track of his/her weight, keep his/her records directly in the medicine tracker and never forget to take pills!
A pill reminder alarm will alert you if you have missed your medication, and will remind you to stick to your medication schedule. Easy to set up and use - the interface is so user-friendly.

<b>Back pain relief - Therapy 4 Secret:</b>
1. Ancient Yoga
2. Vedic Exercise / workout
3. Pranayama
4. Vedic Diet Plan

<b>1. Ancient Yoga</b>
A bit gentle stretching can make a significant impact. Yoga is a mind-body-soul treatment that’s frequently suggested to heal not only back pain but the stress that come with it. Yoga’s focus on balance and steadiness encourages your body to develop defenses against the causes of back pain, which include weak abdominal and pelvic muscles, as well lack of flexibility in the hips.
According to research yoga may even help reduce the need for pain medication.

<b>2. Vedic Exercise / workout</b>
Vedic exercise and workout activities can keep the back healthy by letting discs to exchange fluids which makes it easy receives its nutrition. A healthy disc gets swell up with water and squeeze it out, just like sponge. This sponge action delivers nutrients to the disc.
Exercise can ease stiffness of back muscles and flex the connective fiber of ligaments & tendons. Thus, improves mobility by reducing tension of muscle.
Another vital effect of exercise is that it stretches and repairs muscles. It increases blood circulation to muscle thus boost optimum oxygen supply.
Another advantage of back exercise is that the motion helps lubricate the facet joints, which are synovial joints that need proper motion.

<b>3. Pranayama</b>
The breath is an essential part of yoga practice and pranayama is the formal practice of regulating the breath. PRANA means life force, energy or Qi, & AYAMA is the sanskrit word for ‘extension’. In Chinese Medicine the concept of prana (or Qi) is defined as energy on the verge of materializing.
By breathing more deeply within the pranayama practice, we are boosting more oxygen to the tissues and breaking this cycle. We can also use our breath as a way to calm our nervous system. Extending the exhalation so that it is longer than the inhalation reduces the resting level of the sympathetic nervous system so that the parasympathetic nervous system can conserve energy and we can feel more relaxed.

Perhaps you bent the wrong way while lifting something heavy. Or you're dealing with a degenerative condition like arthritis. Whatever the cause, once you have low back pain, it can be hard to shake. About one in four Americans say they've had a recent bout of low back pain. And almost everyone can expect to experience back pain at some point in their lives.

Sometimes, it’s clearly serious: You were injured, or you feel numbness, weakness, or tingling in the legs. Call the doctor, of course. But for routine and mild low back pain, here are a few simple tips to try at home.

<b>Chill it.</b> Ice is best in the first 24 to 48 hours after an injury because it reduces inflammation.

<b>Keep moving.</b> Our spines are like the rest of our body -- they're meant to move. Keep doing your daily activities. Make the beds, go to work, walk the dog. Once you're feeling better, regular aerobic exercises like swimming, bicycling, and walking can keep you -- and your back -- more mobile. Just don't overdo it. There's no need to run a marathon when your back is sore.

<b>Stay strong.</b> Once your low back pain has receded, you can help avert future episodes of back pain by working the muscles that support your lower back, including the back extensor muscles. Having strong hip, pelvic, and abdominal muscles also gives you more back support. Avoid abdominal crunches, because they can actually put more strain on your back.

<b>Ways to Manage Low Back Pain at Home</b>

<b>Sleep Better:</b> When you have back pain, sleeping can be hard. It can be a vicious cycle because when you don't get enough sleep, your back pain may feel worse. A poor sleep position can also aggravate back pain. 

<b>Good Posture:</b> Grandma was right! Slouching is bad for you. And poor posture can make back pain worse, especially if you sit for long periods. 

<b>Physical Therapy</b>
Physical therapists can teach you how to sit, stand, and move in a way that keeps your spine in proper alignment and alleviates strain on your back.

<b>Keeping a journal can help you manage your chronic pain and pinpoint your most successful treatment options. </b>

Your might have sprained it while working in the yard or cleaning house. Or your back might hurt from an old sports injury or a chronic condition such as arthritis or ankylosing spondylitis.
Sudden or severe back pain should be checked by a doctor or a physical therapist. That also goes for pain that won’t go away.
But sometimes you can treat nagging pain and discomfort on your own.

Our list of the 4 best back pain relief methods;
1. Keep Moving
You might not feel like it when you’re in pain. But this is probably the first thing your doctor will recommend.
A common misconception in patients with isolated back pain is that they can’t stay active. Try to keep up with your usual level of daily activity and movement.

2. Stretch and Strengthen
Strong muscles, especially in your abdominal core, help support your back. Strength and flexibility may help both relieve your pain and prevent it. Yoga, Pilates, and tai chi are just a few of the ways to strengthen your core and the muscles around your hips. Exercise can definitely help.

3. Keep Good Posture

Shedding extra pounds lightens the load on your lower back. Weight loss really helps with back pain because it reduces the amount of mechanical force onto the spine.

Many people who are exploring chronic back pain management can be hesitant to start a pain journal because they worry it will occupy too much of their time.

You should simply make an effort to add information to your pain journal at specific times of the day. Establishing this routine can help you remember to write in your journal on a daily basis.

The segments of the spine are cushioned with cartilage-like pads called disks.

Problems with any of these components can lead to back pain. In some cases of back pain, its cause remains unclear.

Damage can result from strain, medical conditions, and poor posture, among others.

Strain
Back pain commonly stems from strain, tension, or injury. Frequent causes of back pain are:

strained muscles or ligaments
a muscle spasm
muscle tension
damaged disks
injuries, fractures, or falls
Activities that can lead to strains or spasms include:

lifting something improperly
lifting something that is too heavy
making an abrupt and awkward movement
Structural problems
A number of structural problems may also result in back pain.

Ruptured disks: Each vertebra in the spine is cushioned by disks. If the disk ruptures there will be more pressure on a nerve, resulting in back pain.
Bulging disks: In much the same way as ruptured disks, a bulging disk can result in more pressure on a nerve.
Sciatica: A sharp and shooting pain travels through the buttock and down the back of the leg, caused by a bulging or herniated disk pressing on a nerve.
Arthritis: Osteoarthritis can cause problems with the joints in the hips, lower back, and other places. In some cases, the space around the spinal cord narrows. This is known as spinal stenosis.
Abnormal curvature of the spine: If the spine curves in an unusual way, back pain can result. An example is scoliosis, in which the spine curves to the side.
Osteoporosis: Bones, including the vertebrae of the spine, become brittle and porous, making compression fractures more likely.
Kidney problems: Kidney stones or kidney infection can cause back pain.
Movement and posture
Back pain can also result from some everyday activities or poor posture.

Examples include:

twisting
coughing or sneezing
muscle tension
over-stretching
bending awkwardly or for long periods
pushing, pulling, lifting, or carrying something
standing or sitting for long periods
straining the neck forward, such as when driving or using a computer
long driving sessions without a break, even when not hunched
sleeping on a mattress that does not support the body and keep the spine straight
Other causes
Some medical conditions can lead to back pain.

Cauda equina syndrome: The cauda equine is a bundle of spinal nerve roots that arise from the lower end of the spinal cord. Symptoms include a dull pain in the lower back and upper buttocks, as well as numbness in the buttocks, genitalia, and thighs. There are sometimes bowel and bladder function disturbances.
Cancer of the spine: A tumor on the spine may press against a nerve, resulting in back pain.
Infection of the spine: A Fever and a tender, warm area on the back could be due to an infection of the spine.
Other infections: Pelvic inflammatory disease, bladder, or kidney infections may also lead to back pain.
Sleep disorders: Individuals with sleep disorders are more likely to experience back pain, compared with others.
Shingles: An infection that can affect the nerves may lead to back pain. This depends on which nerves are affected.","1,000+",0.0,Health & Fitness,USD,0.0,True

Guidelines and conventional decision aids provide average treatment effects and suggestions based on the average patient. However, each patient has unique characteristics that may affect benefits and risks. Back Pain Tracker is an interactive app that helps personalize treatment.

Back pain is a major and growing source of pain and disability.  The Institute of Medicine included “Comparing the effectiveness of treatment strategies for low back pain without neurological deficit or spinal deformity” in the top quartile of 100 research priorities in 2009. In U.S. national surveys, LBP is the most frequent type of pain, reported by about half of adults in the past year.  It accounts for 34 million office visits annually to primary care physicians. An estimated 7 million adults have activity limitations due to low back pain. It is considered one of the most vexing health problems of our time. Back pain most commonly occurs without leg numbness or weakness and cannot be reliably attributed to a specific cause (“non-specific back pain”). The optimal strategy for treating such patients is uncertain. The efficacy of treatments is moderate at best. A significant proportion develop persistent disabling pain despite use of first-line therapies such as analgesics, exercise therapy, or cognitive behavioral therapy. Invasive treatments and surgery have limited efficacy and significant risks. Our goal is to help each patient with back pain choose the treatment that is right for them, and engage patients for long term self-assessment using Patient Reported Outcomes (PRO)scores, potentially for more than 5 years, when many patients start reporting deterioration in pain and function following back surgery. BPT has the potential to help improve outcomes for patients with back pain.

BPT as an interactive technology to help patients with personalized Shared Decision Making (SDM) in conjunction with their healthcare providers on the appropriateness of the wide range of treatments available for back pain. Too frequently patients are unable to match their treatment decisions with their preferences because they do not fully understand the risks and benefits of the different options. Patients frequently hold mistaken beliefs about their diagnosis and risks/benefits associated with treatments. BPT helps align an individual patient’s values and preferences with the patient’s treatment choice through SDM. Unique features of great significance in the BPT are: (1) providing patients with information that balances risks and benefits of treatment options, (2) eliciting preferences based on realistic goals of care, and (3) integrating PROs in the decision-making process at the point-of-care.

The application was developed through a user-centered design approach to design the user interface for ease of use by patients in entering PRO data and to present time-trended PROs that are understandable for patients, including personalized estimates of normative outcomes based on patients’ age, sex and other features. Integration of PROs in the decision-making process at the point-of-care and helping patients directly understand and use benchmarked PRO scores are important novel aspects of our approach. PROs developed by the NIH Task Force on Research Standards for Chronic Low Back Pain and the NIH Patient Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System Computer Adaptive Tests (PROMIS CATs) interact with and “feed” the SDM process. In particular, the integration of individual patient factors adds to the risk/benefit discussion in the decision for surgery. The scientific premise for BPT is supported by strong clinical evidence and preliminary works. This type of system has been shown to improve patient knowledge and engage the patient for more personalized care. SDM can reduce rates of discretionary surgery and improve patient satisfaction.",100+,0.0,Health & Fitness,USD,0.0,True

It has been developed by world-leading clinicians and technologists to help people access convenient and cost-effective care for spines, joints and muscles. 

The application is suitable for people with or without an injury or condition. 

For those seeking help for a painful condition, a chatbot asks you questions about your condition and then analyses your answers to provide the likely diagnosis of your problem. The assessments have been approved through a process undertaken by a leading London University.

The app then provides video-based exercise programs and advice that has been designed from the best available scientific evidence. For every exercise prescribed in the app there is a link to information showing why that particular exercise is effective for treating a condition like yours. Furthermore, the analysis of the outcomes of 100,000 rehabilitation programs has been used to inform the decision on what exercises to include in treatment programs.

If you are seeking programs to strengthen muscles or improve mobility, our assessment can personalise a program just for you. You can also add a variety of Pilates, yoga, stretching and mobility programs to your routine. All of the programs require minimal equipment so they are perfect for doing at home.

Your exercise program progresses with your feedback. So if an exercise or program isn’t quite right for you, or it’s becoming too easy, the app will adjust the program to be more suitable.

Log and track your strength and aerobic physical activity each week to help you reach your goals, and compare with World Health Organization guidelines. You can add reminders to keep on track, record your symptoms to check your progress and request appointments to see or speak to a real physiotherapist. You can also integrate with the Health app so you can monitor your daily steps within the app.

Chronic pain,Exercises to Reduce Chronic Pa,https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/CLrONEhgMZTVYHMydFYC3bp1ny_vfUvitz1J35TslUbfrtg6GglRMUFJo9K8an-cNy4,"Regardless of the cause — hunching over a smartphone, sitting at a desk all day, or even injury — stretching and strengthening exercises can go a long way in your recovery. Stretching helps restore and maintain flexibility, promote range of motion, and improve blood flow — all of which can alleviate pain.

Exercise is an effective treatment for chronic pain.
While medical treatments and physical therapy are vital components of managing chronic pain symptoms, increased physical activity as a daily habit can increase quality of life. In this app we share with you simple exercises you can do to help alleviate the pain.

If you have back or joint pain, there are probably some times when all you want to do is lie in bed all day. It’s tempting, but it might make the problem worse. Doctors used to prescribe bed rest for back pain and other chronic pain conditions, but studies have found that people who exercise and stay flexible manage their pain much better than those who don’t.

Stretching and yoga are often valuable exercises for the improvement of chronic pain. Maintaining good posture, gentle stretching and relaxation exercises are helpful pain-reduction tools to incorporate into a daily routine.

Strength training can significantly ease chronic pain and benefit a person’s overall health. Workouts that use free weights or resistance machines are helpful for balanced strength training. Starting slowly and building strength gradually is important to prevent injury.

Chronic pain,Pain Log - For Tracking and Ma,https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/CiNKFyMDpmXuQY6u2KfjHLMeCkofCr5xr7flnoFPfblbWqq4FRiiKeoeE5OVVHd1i38,"Are you experiencing pain and finding it difficult to remember the details to discuss with doctors? This pain log app will help you keep track of your pain not to have to rely on your memory. A pain log tracks degree of pain, symptoms, and medications, and activities that cause discomfort. With this pain log you can easily record your experiences and then print and take to your medical provider, or save in a digital format. 

<b>Use this diary to record your pain and what you did to ease it each day.</b>
When one is in constant pain, the overall mobility can be affected and one can become dependent on medication for relief. Moreover, there is a higher risk of mental health issues, such as depression and anxiety. Keeping track of one’s pain in a pain log can be beneficial, in the sense that it will guide the diagnosis in the right direction and it will help one’s physician recommend more adequate treatment solutions. By keeping a diary of your pain, you might be able to discover if stress, sleep deprivation or weather changes have contributed to your symptoms or not. 

This diary is ideal for;
- complaints / pain in your back, shoulders or neck.
- fibromyalgia, rheumatism and arthritis
- chronic pain

A pain diary can play an instrumental role in the management of chronic pain and help health professionals to gain a comprehensive understanding of the pain experienced by the patient. This helps to avoid gaps in the history, and certain patterns that can be addressed with or without pharmacological intervention can be implemented.

The benefits of a pain diary are clear and it is evident that recording the characteristics and changes of your pain can help to improve overall management. Keeping a pain diary can assist to:
- Establish patterns of pain (e.g. flare ups at certain times, temperatures or after activities)
- Understand effective management techniques (e.g. which therapies provide best pain relief)
- Improve patient-practitioner communication (e.g. more comprehensive information to make therapeutic decisions)

It is not necessary to note every moment that pain is experienced, which could be counterproductive due to increased focus on pain and higher rates of non-adherence.

Instead, it is recommended to make an entry in the diary at certain times throughout the day, often in the morning, midday and before bed. This helps to maintain a regular record of events that provides valuable information about pain and its management. Additionally, it limits the recording of pain to certain times and should not lead to an increased focus on pain at other times of the day.","1,000+",0.0,Health & Fitness,USD,0.0,True

It’s actually a good tip: That way, you can remember your triggers and identify trends over time, which can help you figure out which medications and treatments are working, and even potentially learn more about what’s causing your back pain. Another huge advantage: pain tracking helps you give a more detailed picture of your health to your doctor.

<b>Keeping a journal can help you manage your chronic pain and pinpoint your most successful treatment options. </b>
Back pain is one of the most common physical ailments. Studies show that eight in 10 Americans have back pain at some point in their lives, usually in the lower back.

Your might have sprained it while working in the yard or cleaning house. Or your back might hurt from an old sports injury or a chronic condition such as arthritis or ankylosing spondylitis.
Sudden or severe back pain should be checked by a doctor or a physical therapist. That also goes for pain that won’t go away.
But sometimes you can treat nagging pain and discomfort on your own.

Our list of the 4 best back pain relief methods;
1. Keep Moving
You might not feel like it when you’re in pain. But this is probably the first thing your doctor will recommend.
A common misconception in patients with isolated back pain is that they can’t stay active. Try to keep up with your usual level of daily activity and movement.

2. Stretch and Strengthen
Strong muscles, especially in your abdominal core, help support your back. Strength and flexibility may help both relieve your pain and prevent it. Yoga, Pilates, and tai chi are just a few of the ways to strengthen your core and the muscles around your hips. Exercise can definitely help.

3. Keep Good Posture
This helps ease the pressure on your lower back.

4. Maintain a Healthy Weight
Shedding extra pounds lightens the load on your lower back. Weight loss really helps with back pain because it reduces the amount of mechanical force onto the spine.

Many people who are exploring chronic back pain management can be hesitant to start a pain journal because they worry it will occupy too much of their time. However, you do not have to document every moment you experience pain for this practice to be worthwhile. You should simply make an effort to add information to your pain journal at specific times of the day. Establishing this routine can help you remember to write in your journal on a daily basis. Writing a few times a day also allows you to record what you are experiencing in more detail than if you only create a single entry for the same period.","1,000+",0.0,Medical,USD,0.0,True

<b>Back pain relief - Therapy 4 Secret:</b>
1. Ancient Yoga
2. Vedic Exercise / workout
3. Pranayama
4. Vedic Diet Plan

<b>1. Ancient Yoga</b>
A bit gentle stretching can make a significant impact. Yoga is a mind-body-soul treatment that’s frequently suggested to heal not only back pain but the stress that come with it. Yoga’s focus on balance and steadiness encourages your body to develop defenses against the causes of back pain, which include weak abdominal and pelvic muscles, as well lack of flexibility in the hips.
According to research yoga may even help reduce the need for pain medication.

<b>2. Vedic Exercise / workout</b>
Vedic exercise and workout activities can keep the back healthy by letting discs to exchange fluids which makes it easy receives its nutrition. A healthy disc gets swell up with water and squeeze it out, just like sponge. This sponge action delivers nutrients to the disc.
Exercise can ease stiffness of back muscles and flex the connective fiber of ligaments & tendons. Thus, improves mobility by reducing tension of muscle.
Another vital effect of exercise is that it stretches and repairs muscles. It increases blood circulation to muscle thus boost optimum oxygen supply.
Another advantage of back exercise is that the motion helps lubricate the facet joints, which are synovial joints that need proper motion.

<b>3. Pranayama</b>
The breath is an essential part of yoga practice and pranayama is the formal practice of regulating the breath. PRANA means life force, energy or Qi, & AYAMA is the sanskrit word for ‘extension’. In Chinese Medicine the concept of prana (or Qi) is defined as energy on the verge of materializing.
By breathing more deeply within the pranayama practice, we are boosting more oxygen to the tissues and breaking this cycle. We can also use our breath as a way to calm our nervous system. Extending the exhalation so that it is longer than the inhalation reduces the resting level of the sympathetic nervous system so that the parasympathetic nervous system can conserve energy and we can feel more relaxed.

Chronic pain,Overcoming pain based on EMDR,https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/MbdGJPb6W4ly5le_55V_uHqmi6xdhKEl05UVOl3TxMx1vSklkLUNyAIPQkczqZzVk8SC,"“Overcoming pain based on EMDR” was brought to you by Mark Grant, well known Australian psychologist/researcher and writer. Mark is particularly interested in developing resources that sufferers of pain and stress can use to make a real difference in their suffering. He is motivated to do what works best for his clients rather than what the ‘accepted wisdom’ might say. But he maintains a scientific approach and has conducted several studies regarding the efficacy of EMDR as a treatment for chronic pain. 

“Overcoming pain based on EMDR” mobile application is using recent discoveries from brain science to alleviate chronic pain and severe stress. 

The application comprises 3 playlists for controlling pain and associated stress that can maintain pain. 

Each playlist is designed with different goals in mind. Where the first playlist called “Mental Healing strategies” is aimed to alleviate mild or moderate chronic pain, the second playlist called “Sensory Healing strategies” will help when you are too tired, sore or distressed to employ the pain pathway strategy from the first playlist. And the last playlist called “Stress Management” is focused on reducing your stressful feelings that can maintain and exacerbate chronic pain. 

The playlists are designed to compliment each other; so if your pain is severe using the strategies in “Sensory Healing strategies” should help bring it under control enough for you to benefit from the tracks in “Mental Healing strategies” and listening to the “Stress Management” tracks regularly, when your pain is tolerable, will bring your overall stress levels down and decrease the pain-related activity in your body and your brain. The tracks in “Mental Healing strategies” and “Stress management” can be listened to anywhere anytime, but the tracks in “Sensory Healing strategies” require external materials and preparation.

One of the key elements of this app is bilateral stimulation (bls), which is derived from EMDR (Eye Movement Desensitization and Reprocessing). In conjunction with focused attention bls uses sensory stimulation to change physical emotional and cognitive processes associated with chronic pain (as well as trauma and stress). 

For best results you should listen to the tracks that incorporate bls with headphones or hear-buds. You can use the app anytime anywhere but a quiet environment when you don’t feel too overwhelmed by stress or physical discomfort is best. 

If you don’t get the response you expect when listening to the tracks never force yourself or get frustrated, just relax and trust that the relief you are seeking will happen sooner or later.

While every effort has been made to provide a genuinely useful resource this app should not be considered a substitute for professional advice or treatment. In addition to standard medical care you should at the consider seeking psychotherapy, improving your diet, exercising regularly etc. 
For curious minds there’s a number of articles presented in the application where you can read more about both EMDR and chronic pain and bilateral stimulation healing effect. 
You can also read more about chronic pain and how to overcome it from the Mark Grant’s book called “Change Your Brain Change Your Pain” which you can also order by following the link in “Overcoming pain based on EMDR” placed under “Other Resources” section.","1,000+",3.75,Health & Fitness,USD,5.99,False

Pain is the driving force of health care services, and lost productivity. It is a significant burden for those individuals who suffer with it, as well as those who support them. 

Standard medical treatment for chronic pain is often inadequate, and it is common for frustrated patients to seek costly treatments from multiple healthcare professionals, often without significant relief. This can lead some people to believe they cannot be helped.

However, there is some good news. A growing awareness of the limitations of currently available pain treatments make the use of suggestion-based techniques and self-hypnosis an attractive component of pain treatment.


The empirical support for hypnosis for chronic pain management has flourished over the past two decades. Clinical trials show that suggestion based techniques are effective for reducing chronic pain, although outcomes vary between individuals. 

The findings from these clinical trials also show that such treatments have a number of positive effects beyond pain control. Many other treatment outcomes improve too. 

Better still you can apply suggestion-based strategies to yourself and get results.","1,000+",4.3076925,Medical,USD,0.0,True

WHY DID WE MAKE THIS?
You hurt. Your pain is chronic and complicated. You can’t remember everything. You want your doctors to understand, but you don’t know how to explain what you feel.

PAIN IS LIFE-CHANGING. HELP IS HERE.
Nanolume® developed the Pain Tracker & Diary to help you record the daily textures, intensities, and locations of what you feel, so you and your care team can better understand what you are suffering with and follow how your pain responds to medications and treatments.

TRACK IT BETTER. TREAT IT BETTER.
Pain is a complex experience. It often includes multiple pain types (layers), each with its own unique texture, intensity, location, and surface area.

By keeping a diary that integrates complex information, you can show your doctors what you are experiencing to help them make a better diagnosis, choose more appropriate medications and treatments, and monitor if your treatments are beneficial. In addition, by keeping such an integrated record, trends might emerge that would otherwise go unnoticed.  

PAIN IS DIFFERENT.
Pain is a subjective (not objective) sensation that you cannot measure. Its assessment relies on each person’s ability to communicate what they feel. Nanolume® developed this digital diary to help you record what you feel every day. 

INCLUDED FEATURES.
For each diary entry you create:
• Choose a Pain Type. Choose from a list of predefined pain types or create a customized pain type. Next, tap the icon of the pain type you feel is most intense (you can come back and add more types later).
• Select the Intensity. Select the intensity of your pain type using a Numeric Rating Scale (NRS).
• Draw an Outline. Use your finger to draw an “outline” of the type of pain you are experiencing on the front and back sides of a generalized map of your body.
• Calculated Surface Areas. The app displays the percent [%] of your body surface affected by each (or all) of the pain types you draw.
• Zoom. Need to see a larger image of your hand or foot? Double-tap: once to zoom x2; twice to zoom x4; a third time to restore the original size.
• Notes. Tap the “Notepad” icon located in the top-left corner of each opened diary entry to record any details of your medications or treatment results.
• Tap ""Add Pain."" Choose another pain type (layer) to draw.
• Save Your Diary Entry. Tap ""Done"" to create a snapshot of all the pain type layers you drew. The app attaches the date and time your entry was saved.
• Open a Saved Entry. Tap on the date and time of the entry you want to review. Look at the intensity, location, and surface area of each pain type you experienced (by touching the icon of the pain type you want to see) or see all the pain types at once and see how they overlap (tap the ""All Layers"" icon). Swipe the picture left or right to check how your other pain entries compare over time.
• Charts. View a summary of your data in ""Charts.""
• Forget to Save an Entry? Go back and recreate a ""pain picture"" from the past; then, use the ""Calendar"" icon to backdate the recreated entry.
• Calendar Backdating. Touch the ""Calendar"" icon to backdate any pain-picture you draw to create a record of what you remember from the past.
• Copy/Edit. Copy or edit a copy of a previous entry.

Feeling disorganised, confused, isolated or overwhelmed by a cancer diagnosis? You are not alone.

CancerAid was founded by two oncologists to assist you in managing cancer. The app is designed to help you take control over physical and psychological side effects from the moment of diagnosis, through treatment and during recovery. 

The CancerAid app lets you keep track of your diagnostic and treatment information, access medically reliable information to learn more about your condition, track and manage your side effects, nominate your care team and gain access to a motivational community, all in one place.

Use the app in the comfort of your own home, in the waiting room, during appointments or out and about. CancerAid is available when you need it the most, anywhere and anytime.

Be Better Equipped to Discuss Side Effects with Your Doctor

It’s ok not to be ok. The CancerAid app makes it easy to record and monitor symptoms and medication use over time. We understand that it's not always possible to log symptoms when they occur so we have made it possible to track in real time and retrospectively. 

Research has shown that patients who record their symptoms and share these with their clinical care team experience improved outcomes. Refer back to the app when speaking to your nurse or doctor to help them better understand your body changes and feels. 

If you are not experiencing any side effects or symptoms, great! Let your care team know that you are feeling well by entering a low severity in the app. Logging your wellness regularly is as important as logging your symptoms, and helps physicians make decisions on your treatment. 

Who’s in your corner? 

You can nominate your care team and loved ones with the Champion feature to keep them in the loop of how you are going. In your CancerAid journal, you can share your experiences and milestones in a secure place available to you and your nominated Champions. 

Champions let you share information with all your loved ones at once.
Support for Caregivers 

Cancer is not a one man disease, and we recognise that caregivers also need useful tools and support through the cancer timeline. If you are caring for someone affected by cancer you can request to follow their progress in the app so that you know when they need you the most. 

The app is filled with helpful resources for caregivers. The in-app community lets you read other carer’s tips and experiences, the cancer profile holds information on specific cancer types, treatments and what to expect from them. 

CancerAid is One of the Most Trusted Cancer Resources Available

CancerAid is endorsed by several leading Cancer Hospitals, Health Insurance Providers, and Cancer Charities. CancerAid has been awarded Best Start up Creating Social Impact by Richard Branson of Virgin Group and Best Global Startup by Steve Wozniak, Co-Founder of Apple.

When it comes to a diet rich in cancer-fighting substances, most experts agree that it should consist of a predominantly plant-based diet. ""If you have two-thirds of plant food on your plate, that seems to be enough to avoid excessive amounts of food high in saturated fat. That seemingly simple advice could mean a drastic change in diet for many people.

People who are thinking that this is like a diet, and are trying to choke this stuff down, it's never going to last. You're looking at creating something for a lifetime. If it takes you awhile, but each month or so you enjoy [one more vegetable], then that's great.

The extracts from cruciferous vegetables as well as those from vegetables of the genus Allium inhibited the proliferation of all tested cancer cell lines whereas extracts from vegetables most commonly consumed in Western countries were much less effective. The antiproliferative effect of vegetables was specific to cells of cancerous origin and was found to be largely independent of their antioxidant properties. These results thus indicate that vegetables have very different inhibitory activities towards cancer cells and that the inclusion of cruciferous and Allium vegetables in the diet is essential for effective dietary-based chemopreventive strategies.

Translation:
- Allium and cruciferous veggies stopped cancer growth.
- Commonly consumed vegetables did not work as well.
- The antioxidant content of veggies was not a key anti-cancer factor.
- Different vegetables work for different cancers.
- Allium and cruciferous veggies should be eaten to prevent cancer.
So the most commonly consumed vegetables in Western countries had very little effect on cancer cell growth. The top three (potatoes, lettuce and carrots) account for 60% of the vegetables we Westerners are eating. 32% of our vegetable intake is potatoes, and half of that is actually french fries. Dark greens, cruciferous veggies and garlic account for less than 1% of our Western diet!

Radishes were shown to stop tumor growth by 95-100% for breast and stomach cancer, but had no effect and may have even increased tumor growth by 20-25% in pancreatic, brain, lung and kidney cancer. Definitely something to keep in mind.

You may want to start with some of the following food substances, all of which show promise as cancer-fighting agents.

Take this list to your next grocery visit, and stock up on these cancer fighting ingredients. And remember to make fruits, vegetables, beans and whole grains the biggest part of every meal. Add some of these healthy foods to your diet to help prevent cancer and keep other diseases at bay.","5,000+",0.0,Health & Fitness,USD,0.0,True

The lifetime probabilities of developing cancers were based on USA data from the National Cancer Institute's (NCI's) Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) Program, collected since 1973 and by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's (CDC's) National Program of Cancer Registries (NPCR), collected since 1995. These figures were adapted by the hazard ratios available in the published peer-reviewed literature. Only risk factors with a quantifiable risk were included. Risk factors requiring complex tests not available to the average clinician were excluded. Meta-analyses were given preference when available.

DISCLAIMER: This application is strictly educational and all information contained herein cannot and should not replace assessment by a physician. The evaluations presented represent our best efforts to conveniently assess cancer risk. However, as significant controversy and widely different study results can persist around the impact of even a single variable in a strictly selected population, this is based on a large number of assumptions, extrapolations and estimates. As not every study includes a multivariate analysis and the effect of some risk factors on certain cancers is so large their effect cannot be eliminated from basic probability, a bias toward overestimation of risk is possible. Furthermore, there is continuous progress in the scientific literature. Any figures should therefore be regarded as indicative, but not precise.
Any information you enter into this application will only be stored on your device and will never be sent to us or to any other party, for any reason.

NCCN is a not-for-profit alliance of leading cancer centers devoted to patient care, research, and education. NCCN is dedicated to improving and facilitating quality, effective, equitable, and accessible cancer care so all patients can live better lives. Through the leadership and expertise of clinical professionals at NCCN Member Institutions, NCCN develops resources that present valuable information to the numerous stakeholders in the health care delivery system. By defining and advancing high-quality cancer care, NCCN promotes the importance of continuous quality improvement and recognizes the significance of creating clinical practice guidelines appropriate for use by patients, clinicians, and other health care decision-makers around the world.


Over the past 25 years, NCCN has developed an integrated suite of tools to improve the quality of cancer care. The NCCN Guidelines® document evidence-based, consensus-driven management to ensure that all patients receive preventive, diagnostic, treatment, and supportive services that are most likely to lead to optimal outcomes.


The NCCN Guidelines are a comprehensive set of guidelines detailing the sequential management decisions and interventions that apply to 97 percent of cancer cases in the United States. In addition, separate guidelines relate to major prevention and screening topics and another set of pathways focuses on the major supportive care areas.


The NCCN Guidelines provide recommendations based on the best evidence available at the time they are derived. Because new data are published continuously, it is essential that the NCCN Guidelines also be continuously updated and revised to reflect new data and new clinical information. The intent of the NCCN Guidelines is to assist in the decision-making process of individuals involved in cancer care—including physicians, nurses, pharmacists, payers, patients and their families—with the ultimate goal of improving patient care and outcomes. The NCCN Guidelines provide recommendations for appropriate care for most but not all patients; however, individual patient circumstances must be considered when applying these recommendations.

Skincare performed without medical intervention will help to get rid of jowls & oedema, wrinkles on the forehead & nasolabial folds. You can download the ‘forYou’ app designed for the best skincare and facial exercises completely free of charge. Practice face-building for 2-3 weeks 10 minutes a day and you will recognise significant positive changes on your skin. It will become softer & more elastic, able to resist new wrinkles.
 
Face-Yoga & self-massage using your own hands without an electric massager can replace expensive cosmetic procedures like lymphatic drainage and lifting. Ultimately facial gymnastics helps to avoid spending vast amounts of money on plastic surgery and painful injections. Apply facial acupressure and pinch massage to get rid of forehead wrinkles and sagging skin. Additionally face-building helps to restore natural skin complexion.
 
Lifting facial massage is a mandatory procedure for people aged over 30. With age skin loses its elasticity & is unable to recover conditions as quickly as young skin. Our application shows you how to carry out facial care massages & and teaches special techniques how to perform skincare exercises yourself. Perform Face Gymnastics with forYou for 15-20 minutes a day to effectively increase skin elasticity and immediately improve skin tone. Home facial massage technique we offer is suitable for men and women of any age. We have only selected safe & effective facial exercises that can help to achieve a sustainable positive result if you do it regularly.
 
ForYou will help to master facial massage on the go & will organically fit face building in your tight schedule. Using the methods of manual facial massage offered by us you can achieve smoothness and elasticity of the skin, a clear line of cheekbones and chin & a beautiful young skin tone.
 
Face-Yoga is the best way to get rid of puffiness & wrinkles. You can download forYou to start facial acupressure practice right now.
 
Facial massage can be mastered at home with the help of our application in a few simple steps. To get started - download forYou, select facial massage treatment that suits you & learn the techniques. Face Gymnastics techniques are presented in the form of a classic, pinching & plastic complex - implemented Augmented Reality (AR) technology will direct you how to perform these techniques.  
 
Acupressure, classic & pinch facial massage can be performed on dry or moist skin. The app will indicate whether your skin requires oil or cream for the treatment in the description of the complex. Particularly for classic & acupressure facial massage skin needs to be pre-moisturized. Carefully read the recommendations & instructions provided in the application to avoid damaging your delicate skin.
 
ForYou provides training on how to master classic facial exercises at home. It takes about 15 minutes to perform the massage treatment. Face-yoga will save your skin from wrinkles and jowls. It will allow you to build the perfect outline of chin & cheekbones. Pinching facial massage performed according to Augmented Reality technique lasts for 10 minutes. Face-building helps to lift the corners of the lips, smooth out the nasolabial folds & tighten the cheeks. Plastic facial massage takes approximately 8 minutes. Same as for the pinched massage technique you can do it without pre-moisturising the skin.

✓ TRACK YOUR SKIN'S PROGRESS

Any time you notice your skin is looking particularly good or bad, you can make a note of it by pressing on the face icon next to the morning or evening routine. You can also add a comment to note down more details for your own record and add photos to track your progress.

If you don't wish to follow the recommended layering order, you can choose to re-order the products to fully customize your routine by selecting the option from the top right menu (with 3 dots) of the Routine section. You can also change the order of the layer steps, for instance DECIEM recommends oils before moisturizers but some users prefer the other way around.


✓ USE CONFLICTING PRODUCTS

When we recommend not using a product due to conflicts with other products or because you've reached the usage limit, you can choose to ignore the warning and use it anyway. You will then have the option to permanently ignore conflicts on that specific product.


✓ SCHEDULE PRODUCTS

You can choose specific days of the week for a product if you wish. For instance, you may wish to make it so that the ""AHA 30% + BHA 2% Peeling Solution"" only appears in your routine on Tuesdays and Fridays.
You can also choose dates of the month, e.g. the 1st and 15th of every month.
Another useful option is to schedule products for every X days, so you could choose every 2 days to alternate.

Losing just 5% to 10% of your total weight can help you lower your blood sugar, blood pressure, and cholesterol levels. Losing weight and eating healthier can also have a profound effect on your mood, energy, and sense of well being. Even if you’ve already developed diabetes, it’s not too late to make a positive change. By eating healthier, being more physically active, and losing weight, you can reduce your symptoms or even reverse diabetes. The bottom line is that you have more control over your health than you may think.

Nutrition and physical activity are important parts of a healthy lifestyle when you have diabetes. Along with other benefits, following a healthy meal plan and being active can help you keep your blood glucose level, also called blood sugar, in your target range. To manage your blood glucose, you need to balance what you eat and drink with physical activity and diabetes medicine if you take any.

Diabetes,Diabetes Tracker,https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/-BlfrGQnCCjg0hjigbB_3CE6hvIUJgQSqkvNKcYz6e0SHtREG7pu8qJXj_90rCtTU56O,"A diary for monitoring blood glucose and nutrition is an important thing in a diabetic's life. The Diabetes Tracker application was created to help both those who faced this diagnosis for the first time and those who have been ill for a long time.

What you can find in the application:
•	Convenient diary with columns for entering the results of multiple measurements
•	Notes where you can enter any other important information: text size - 140 characters
•	An archive that will help, if necessary, to get old information saved earlier than three months ago
•	Statistics - the section where glucose control results are analyzed and interpreted
•	Coloured charts - "" a glucose graph"" for visual monitoring of the results in different periods, e.g. 2 weeks, one month, three months. Users can also see the graph of HbA1c changes in a year.
•	Google drive integration to keep all the results of glucose monitoring safe and confidential
•	Interface settings

What is missing: advertising, paid services, complex ""multi-ways"" to get to the right section, acid colors and other annoying things.

<b>Diary</b>
Every diabetic knows that it is necessary to measure blood glucose several times a day. The application has the ability to enter control results:
•	on an empty stomach and after breakfast
•	before / after lunch and dinner
There is also a column ""Other"", where it is convenient to enter the results of extraordinary measurements - for example, in case of deterioration of health.

<b>Notes</b>
After each measurement, it makes sense to write down exactly what and how much you ate and drank with each meal. You can enter other data - for example, blood pressure, analyzes. These details are also important in their own way. With their help, it is often possible to determine which foods and how they affect not only glucose level, but also blood pressure or other indicators.

<b>Archive</b>
In some cases, to track the dynamics of the disease, the data of previous several months or even years are required. The Diabetes Tracker app stores all measurements and notes earlier than three months in an archive.
When switching to the tab of the same name at the bottom of any of the pages, the user gains access to the old data, which can, for example, be transferred to the physician.

<b>Statistics</b>
A very important section, where the minimum, average and maximum blood glucose measurements of the last two weeks, one month and three months are saved.
Based on them, the average value is displayed. It is automatically converted into the calculated value of glycated hemoglobin - HbA1c. Glycated hemoglobin is one of the most important indicators for determining the success of controlling the course of diabetes of any type.
Depending on the result obtained, a rating is given - good, relative or poor control of diabetes. For more convenience and informational content, the assessment is displayed in green, orange or red.

<b>Interface settings</b>
The application is customizable at user’s request. The following settings have been implemented:
•	Day / night mode (very convenient when you have to measure glucose late in the evening or at night)
•	The units of measurement for glucose are in mmol / L and in mg / dL. The first is commonly used in post-Soviet countries, and the second one - in the USA and Western Europe. Quick change of units is especially suitable for people who travel abroad for consultations and treatment

Also, users can back up data and import it from other files.

RH include issues like abortion, HIV/STIs, maternal health and rights, contraceptive access, gender-based violence, discrimination and stigma and more. Though women with disabilities have the same and sexual and reproductive health needs as other women, they often face barriers to information and services, health rights are often not met. Thus they remain ignorant of basic facts about themselves, their bodies, and their rights to define what they do and do not want. Every individual has the right to make their own choices about their sexual and reproductive health. The challenges are not necessarily part of having a disability, but instead often reflect lack of social attention, legal protection, understanding and support.

Mobile application (App) platforms have the potential to advance sexual and reproductive health. Digital technologies and mobile platforms provides insight into opportunities to advance Sexual and reproductive health. It has the potential to facilitate innovative, efficient ways meeting growing global health needs. Thus, the use of digital technologies for SRH self care could improve correct use of interventions, and empower individuals to better manage their health.","1,000+",0.0,Health & Fitness,USD,0.0,True

Dental health,Dental 3D Illustrations,https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/xQWd10OwGJx7_jlU_mtD8Y9LOC2x5zPGWJvoXkrz3WJHWbHdMteVrxqBFaNtVp44n38,"This application is designed for professional dentists who want to advise their patients more effectively. A large collection of 3D illustrations of dental treatment is sorted into groups and located inside this application.

Quick and easy. Many dentists draw illustrations on paper every time explaining the treatment process to their patients, which can take some time. Finding the necessary illustration in the application database is very simple- it will take you about 10 seconds. 

The 3D illustration is better than a photo. Patients can be shocked and frightened by seeing photographs of blood operations or a real photo of teeth.  If you use 3D illustrations, the patient most likely will perceive such information loyally.

Quality and precision. All illustrations are based on accurate anatomy, real procedures, and treatment, based on the support of professional doctors and dental surgeons. 

Access to the necessary illustrations will be instant regardless of where you are. This application does not use the Internet traffic to download the illustrations, all necessary 3D illustration files are already contained within the application.

Use your materials. You can place your photos in the application using them to demonstrate to your patients. The application does not store your data but only uses the image file from your device in its gallery. 
 
The category of selected illustration topics allows you to access the most frequently used topics even faster. To do this, you will need to transfer the necessary topic to the Favorites section.

The list of topics by category:
⦁	Anatomy of teeth and jaws. Information schemes. 
⦁	Hygiene and teeth whitening. The development of tartar and plaque. Cleaning.  
⦁	Therapy- dental treatment. Different types of caries. 
⦁	Prosthetics. Veneers, Restorations, Bridges, Crowns, Removable prostheses.
⦁	Implantation. Bone Augmentation. Partial and complete rehabilitation of teeth.  
⦁	Orthodontics. Braces, Occlusion, Congenital and acquired defects.
⦁	Periodontology. Various gum problems and their treatment.
⦁	Surgery. Extractions, Hemisection, Sinus-lifting, Bone Augmentation.  

The gallery works on the principle of the slideshow presentation. You open a topic you are interested in, the topic itself can contain 3-9 images. You choose the most suitable illustration and show to the patient and consult him. Next, you can switch the related images from the topic while you continue to consult. 

Using a TV for a demonstration. Read the instructions of your TV and smartphone, most likely you have the opportunity to broadcast on a large TV display. This can probably be implemented as a duplication of the display.

I am constantly working on improving the application creating new illustrations. Please tell us what new topics you might be interested in.

Everyday care
It’s simple: Good habits are the key to better oral health. That means brushing your teeth for two minutes, twice a day, flossing and rinsing regularly, and visiting the dentist every 6 months.

To help you stay on track with your daily routines, we made an app that rewards you every time you treat your teeth right.

How it works
• Pair a quip Smart Brush to auto-track how long & well you brush
• Or manually log your habits with any brush, floss, or mouthwash
• Earn points for tracking good habits & unlocking achievements
• Redeem rewards like free products, retail gift cards, refills, & more

Brush better
Once you pair a quip Smart Brush, it will automatically log every routine (no phone needed!) To review your brush history, open the app with Bluetooth on when it’s close to your brush. Or manually track date and duration with any toothbrush.

Floss & rinse
Cleaning between your teeth at least once a day is recommended by the American Dental Association, alongside a daily refresh with anticavity mouthwash. Track both to make your dentist proud and earn points!

Points & rewards
Stack up daily points for brushing 2 minutes, twice a day (1x with any brush, 10x with a quip Smart Brush!), plus flossing and rinsing. You can also earn bonus points for achievements, like logging 100 brushings! 

Redeem rewards 
Turn your points into amazing rewards from quip and our growing list of partners — updated regularly! Popular rewards include free products, retail gift cards, refills, sweepstakes entries, and more.

Tips & reminders
The dashboard shows if you’re really brushing 2 minutes, twice a day (like dentists recommend!) and flossing and rinsing regularly. Check out tips to improve your habits and push notification reminders so you never miss a routine.

<b>Eye Care App For Mobile</b> provides the method for <b>Eye exercises</b> that may actually help delay the need for glasses or contacts in some people. But you don't need to buy a special program of exercises or follow prescribed visual gymnastics to accomplish these things. If your eyes are tired from excessive close-up work — such as staring at the computer — visual breaks to focus on objects at longer distances are a good idea. And it's important to encourage your visual system to do its best.

Everyone knows that exercising our muscles is good for our health. What about <b>eye exercises</b> to improve eyesight? While there are no effective <b>eye exercises</b> for astigmatism, myopia, or hyperopia, otherwise known as refractive errors, eye exercises can help with optimising visual skills. Vision therapy, a type of physical therapy for the eyes, has been shown to improve certain conditions involving eye alignment and focusing. During <b>vision therapy</b>, a patient is prescribed a set of eye exercises for lazy eye, among other conditions. While being under an eye doctor’s care can provide more guidance on how to use eye exercises, there are some eye muscle exercises that can be done at home. While I wouldn’t expect these eye exercises to improve vision fast, with diligence, they can gradually help with focusing issues and eyestrain.","100,000+",4.6728973,Health & Fitness,USD,0.0,True

Eye muscles should be trained often for winning your eyesight back (eye test). You will see, it will be like one of the eye games.


About our eye: 

Eyes are organs that detect light and convert it into electro-chemical impulses in neurons. The simplest photoreceptors in conscious vision connect light to movement. In higher organisms the eye is a complex optical system which collects light from the surrounding environment, regulates its intensity through a diaphragm, focuses it through an adjustable assembly of lenses to form an image, converts this image into a set of electrical signals.

Visual acuity, or resolving power, is ""the ability to distinguish fine detail"" and is the property of cone cells. It is often measured in cycles per degree (CPD), which measures an angular resolution, or how much an eye can differentiate one object from another in terms of visual angles.

An eye handbook might help you for more info about the eye (or eye tracking).  

Pro version is like an eye magic app with 8 new trainings including dominant eye recognition and an eye color blindness test! An eye quiz with exciting eye illusions will be added later!","100,000+",4.2178216,Health & Fitness,USD,0.0,True

** FEATURES **

HOW BIG IS BABY
The Bump is the original home of the cute fruit.

Prepare to smile and look forward to each week: The Bump compares baby’s growth in utero to beautifully illustrated produce  (“Baby Is As Big As a Peach”) in a way that’s fun and easy to share with friends and family.

Discover comprehensive updates about the changes and developments happening to both baby and your body while you’re pregnant, and learn how best to plan ahead.
 
BABY NAMES
From name length and style to country of origin and meaning, you’ll find baby’s name in one of The Bump’s specially curated lists. 
 
INSIDE THE BUMP
See an exciting and exclusive 3D interactive visualization of baby's week-by-week growth. Interact and learn new facts about baby like never before with the next step in baby growth trackers.

DAILY ADVICE
Every day, the award-winning editorial staff of The Bump delivers fresh and relevant content for your specific week of pregnancy. The articles are timely and comprehensive: always know what’s safe and standard; find out how to ward off morning sickness; learn the best things to pack in your hospital bag; and discover the best prenatal workouts for you.
 
TOOLS
The Bump’s comprehensive suite of helpful tools makes it the versatile free baby app for you. Stay up to date on you and baby’s progress with invaluable tools like the pregnancy countdown tool, baby growth tracker, a due date calculator, a kick counter, a pregnancy weight gain tracker, and a contraction counter  to determine when it’s time to enact your birth plan. And the Bump’s food safety tool provides nutritional guidance and helpful information throughout your pregnancy. 

PLANNER+
A feature that equips every expecting mom with important information about their prenatal doctor visits. It suggests questions to ask your doctor and integrates appointments seamlessly with your mobile phone's  calendar.

REGISTRY
The Bump is solving two of Baby Registry’s biggest challenges:

+ The Bump has collected the top registry products across Amazon, buybuy Baby, Target, Walmart and so much more, complete with reviews from parents who’ve been where you are. This registry has only grown over time, so you can be sure you’ll find everything you want and need.

+ The typical mom-to-be will register at two or more stores, because there are always some items that require a special, secondary registry. When it comes to managing multiple registries, the Bump has you covered. The Bump will automatically track your registries across each retailer, so you can keep tabs on what you’ve registered for, what’s been bought and what’s still waiting on your registry.

One Million Babies är gravidappen som ger dig korrekt individanpassad information om din graviditet och den första tiden med barnet.  Appen är utvecklad av ett team bestående av barnmorska, förlossningsläkare och professor från Karolinska Institutet som forskar kring graviditet. De har tagit fram unika algoritmer för One Million Babies som gör det möjligt att få individanpassad information om din graviditet. Du anger värden om dig själv och din graviditet så kan appen beräkna:
- När det är mest sannolikt att du kommer föda och på vilket sätt?
- Hur stort är ditt barn nu och när det föds?
- Hur stor är din sannolikhet för att föda tidigt/sent?
- Vilken är din risk för komplikationer?

Allt om att vara gravid - Kvalitetsinformation
Dessutom finns det över 200 lättlästa informationstexter och mer än 50 informativa filmer om graviditet som alla är skrivna och inspelade av läkare/barnmorskor och dessutom granskade av oberoende experter i en unik kunskapsbank. Här hittar du svar på nästan allt det som du som gravid undrar över. Saknar du något så hör bara av dig så svarar vi dig och lägger till det till appen.

Gravidkalender - vecka för vecka
Följ din graviditet vecka för vecka. Läs om allt som händer och hur barnet och mamman utvecklas just nu. Håll koll på vilken vecka och trimester du är i just nu.

Håll koll på allt som händer hos barnmorskan
- Läs om de olika barnmorskebesöken. Vad sker vid nästa besök och vilka kontroller gör man hos barnmorskan? Appen beskriver detaljerat alla dina barnmorskebesök.
- Registrera och spara alla mätvärden som barnmorskan tar. Hos barnmorskan mäter du vikt, blodtryck, blodvärde och mycket. Lägg in värdena i appen så får du fina kurvor och grafer där du kan se din utveckling och läsa mer om vad de betyder. Du kan också se hur dina värden ligger jämfört med normalvärden för dig. 
- Lägg in nästa besök i appens kalender.

Vad kan jag äta?
När man är gravid kan det vara svårt att hålla reda på vad du kan äta och vad du bör undvika. Här finns ett enkelt verktyg där snabbt kan söka fram över 1000 livsmedel och direkt få svar. Är det ok att äta broccoli?  Kan jag äta mozzarella?

Mediciner?
I appen kan du söka bland nästan alla läkemedel som säljs i Sverige och läsa hur/om de påverkar din graviditet.

Träna när du är gravid?
En hel avdelning i appen handlar om tips och råd kring träning under din graviditet. Vilka övningar är bra och vilka bör jag undvika? Hur mycket bör jag träna? Här får du korrekta svar.

Vad ska barnet heta?
Ange dina favoriter! Få inspiration i topplistor, både historiska och aktuella. Dela med dig av dina förslag och se dina följares förslag.

Dagbok och foton
Dokumentera dina tankar under din graviditet och ta bilder under resan. 

Spara alla värden som en PDF
Appen låter dig dynamiskt skapa en PDF som beskriver din graviditet. Du väljer vilka delar du vill ha med, tex bilder från dagboken, mätvärden från barnmorskebeöken, hur du mått mm. Sedan skapas en PDF som du kan spara eller dela som du vill.

Låt andra följa din graviditet!
Du kan enkelt dela din graviditet med andra genom appen. Välj i detalj vilken information du vill dela med dig av. Kanske din partner får se allt men kompisarna får nöja sig med övergripande information och dina förslag på namn?

Om oss
Vi är ett team bestående av förlossningsläkare, barnmorska, professor och utvecklare som brinner för att göra ge alla gravida en tryggare och säkrare graviditet. Vi vill att du ska ha tillgång till korrekt och saklig information som du kan lita på.

Pediatrics or child care is the branch of medicine dealing with the health and medical care of infants, children, and adolescents from birth up to the age of 18. The word “paediatrics” means “healer of children”; they are derived from two Greek words: (pais = child) and (iatros = doctor or healer). Paediatrics is a relatively new medical specialty, developing only in the mid-19th century.

<b>Aims of pediatrics</b>
The aims of the study of paediatrics is to reduce infant and child rate of deaths, control the spread of infectious disease, promote healthy lifestyles for a long disease-free life and help ease the problems of children and adolescents with chronic conditions.

injuries
infections
genetic and congenital conditions

PedsGuide is a multi-module pediatric clinical decision-support tool intended for use only by professional health care providers and emergency personnel for informational and educational purposes.*  Each module provides users with a step-by-step interactive clinical decision support process, including reference material and/or contextually relevant information based on evidence-based practice and expert opinion routinely used in clinical practice, to assist in management of various acute illnesses in children. 

The modules have been designed and optimized by an interdisciplinary team of clinicians, pharmacists, medical librarians, Human Factors scientists, and innovations professionals.  Human Factors methodology was leveraged to guide interfaces that provide rapid access to information and assessment tools, which facilitate an efficient aid for care management while decreasing cognitive load for the user. Additionally, for users who seek care for patients at The Children’s Mercy Hospital, Pedsguide features a quick-call feature to contact the Children’s Mercy Contact Center and Critical Care Transport Team.

* While PedsGuide is a helpful tool, it is not intended to replace the independent judgment and evaluation of health care providers and emergency personnel. Healthcare providers and emergency personnel should not rely primarily on the tool to make a clinical diagnosis or treatment decision.  Children's Mercy is not responsible for the correctness of any action you take based upon your use of PedsGuide

He identified the lacunas and felt the urgent need for developing Geriatric Care Services for the Senior Citizens, especially who are mostly living alone due to fast growing nuclear families and migration of their children to distant places to earn their living. Being a doctor, he was the best person to identify the most important needs of them – Healthy Ageing, Medical Emergency specially at Night, Home Health Care and Training of Manpower to Care for special needs of the Seniors. He built up a highly coordinated, committed and cohesive team of Trained, Experienced and Compassionate Elder Care Professionals consisting of Doctors, Nurses, Physiotherapists, Geriatric Animators, Dieticians, Psychologists and many others. Initially the service was available only to his close contacts and patients but now it is being available for ALL the Citizens of the City of Joy.

There are several features of ""Geriatric Depression Test - Self Harm Tracker"", namely:
🔸 Simple and very easy to use depression tracker app.
🔸 Precise interpretation with the Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS).
🔸 Early recognition of depression in the elderly population.
🔸 It is totally free. Download now!

While there are many instruments available to measure depression, the Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS), first created by Yesavage, et al., has been tested and used extensively with the older population. The geriatric depression scale test is considered an ideal evaluation and monitoring tool that is easy to administer and does not require any specific training for the clinician. However, ""Geriatric Depression Test - Self Harm Tracker"" should not be performed as the sole diagnosis tool and should be accompanied by other means of mental status evaluation.

Please note that A Walk Through Dementia will only work on devices equipped with a gyroscope for cardboard compatibility. You can still experience A Walk Through Dementia in YouTube 360 videos at http://www.awalkthroughdementia.org/.

Voiced by Dame Harriet Walter, and with an introduction from Jon Snow, A Walk Through Dementia is designed to help users think beyond memory loss to gain a fuller understanding of the practical and emotional impact of the condition. The app uses a combination of computer generated environments and 360 degree video sequences to illustrate in powerful detail how even the most everyday task of making a cup of tea can become a challenge for someone with dementia.

Unfolding over three scenarios, the user is tasked with buying ingredients, taking them home and making a cup of tea for their family. A supermarket environment reveals difficulties at the checkout, counting money, reading the shopping list, busy environments and finding items. 

A second street sequence illustrates problems people with dementia may face with navigation, visual-spatial problems and disorientation. 

Finally, back at home, making tea for visiting family presents challenges around memorising instructions, visual symptoms and coordination problems.

This will help us map the spread of the virus in Ireland. Understanding how the virus is affecting the country will help us to manage and respond to this pandemic.

Contact tracing
The app uses your phone’s technology to make a record of when you are close to other app users. If an app user tests positive for COVID-19, the HSE can ask them for the records on the app. This will help us to contact other people who might have been affected, and give them the advice and help they need.

DCC Storage
Users who have received a paper version of their European Digital Covid Certificate can now digitise it by uploading it into the COVIDTracker App.
This new function allows users to scan the QR code provided on their DCC into the COVIDTracker app for digital storage.

Your data and privacy

publicly identify anyone with COVID-19 
make personal data available to the HSE without your direct consent 
use your data for any reason other than contact tracing and anonymously reporting illness levels

Vaccination tracker,COVIDWISE,https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/ACfAOBoDuPVw-c3_H1HnCPVuM8HZ8VUArAF4bOQZMfvzy2-hVmQmBPKFdKU5MimTSy2S,"COVIDWISE is the official COVID-19 exposure notification app for the Commonwealth of Virginia’s Department of Health (VDH).  The app was developed in partnership with SpringML using a Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) API framework created through a unique collaboration between Apple and Google.

Your personal use of COVIDWISE will significantly help inform Virginians suspected of having been within close proximity to someone with a positive COVID-19 diagnosis. When you download COVIDWISE, you are doing your part to efficiently and effectively help your community stay ahead of any potential resurgent trends in cases. This is vitally important as the business sector, healthcare industry, K-12 schools, institutions of higher education, religious organizations, sporting/recreation activities, and others rely on appropriate interventions to ensure the health of our communities and maintain economic viability. 

How COVIDWISE Works: 
If someone reports to the app that they tested positive, the signals from their app will search for other app users who shared that signal. The BLE signals are date-stamped and the app estimates how close the two devices were based on signal strength. If the timeframe was at least 15 minutes and the estimated distance was within six feet, then the other user receives a notification of a possible exposure. No names! No location! 

The BLE framework within COVIDWISE will run in the background, even if the exposure notification app is closed. It will not drain the device battery at a rate that would occur with other apps that use normal Bluetooth and/or are open and running constantly.

How COVIDWISE Protects Your Privacy:
VDH takes your privacy and confidentiality very seriously. This is why we chose to use the Apple and Google BLE framework. No personal data or location tracking occurs within this app. In fact, there is no need for VDH to know where or who you are for COVIDWISE to work. If you are close enough to another app user, the BLE technology will share signals with that user. 

Laboratory results for all persons who test positive for COVID-19 are sent to VDH. This is not associated with the app. Our staff follows up with persons reported as positive, based on information provided within the laboratory report. 

Anonymously Share Positive Test Results With COVIDWISE:
When VDH receives any positive COVID-19 lab result registered with a valid mobile phone number, we will automatically send a text message to that individual, which provides rapid notification and encourages them to stay home and away from other people. The text also lets individuals who have tested positive know they may retrieve an 8-digit verification code from the COVIDWISE Verification Portal at https://apps.vdh.virginia.gov/CWP. You must enter your last name, date of birth, and the phone number that matches the information from your registered COVID-19 test to verify your positive result.

You may use that 8-digit verification code in order to anonymously report a positive result to the app. This prevents people from falsely reporting positive results, which could generate false exposure notifications. VDH wants all app users to feel confident that when a possible COVID-19 exposure is received via the app, that it is a real event. 

If you have the current Apple or Google operating system installed on your device, you may have noticed that Exposure Notifications are now included. Apple and Google will delete the exposure notification service tools from their respective operating systems once the pandemic reaches a point that public health no longer requires the use of this technology.

What should we do in case of danger? Let’s take a look!

In Case of Being Bitten by a Pet
Cut the soap into pieces and put them in water. Make soapy water to clean the wound. Take a cotton swab to dip in the disinfectant and apply it to the wound. Kids, if you are bitten by a pet, call for emergency medical services and go to the hospital for treatment! 

In Case of Sprain or Cut
The little girl has a sprained ankle. Her arm is injured too. She needs first aid! Take an ice pack and put it on the sprained ankle to reduce the swelling! Then wrap it with a bandage. Don't forget to pad her feet to alleviate the pain! Wait! Please also apply disinfectant to her arm and wrap it with bandage. 

In Case of Bruising After a Fall
The little boy suffered a bruise after falling down. Please help him with the treatment of the wound! First, remove the leaves on the wound, and apply saline solution to the wound to rinse it clean. Then apply an ointment and put a band-aid on it! Kids, please watch your step when you walk! 

Baby Panda also offers first aid tips for accidents such as scalds, bee sting, and insects in the eye. 
Through learning these tips, we hope kids can better protect themselves in case of an emergency.

Welke ongevallen? Geen ziekenhuis of 112, wel EHBO
De app is vooral bedoeld voor ongevallen waarbij niet direct medische hulp van een arts nodig is, maar waarbij het wel noodzakelijk is om zelf eerste hulp te verlenen. De app geeft je daarbij de informatie die je nodig hebt. Wat doe je bijvoorbeeld na contact met de haartjes van de eikenprocessierups of met de sappen van de berenklauw? Wat doe je met een splinter of met een bloedneus?

Per ongeval of situatie geven we aan hoe je de situatie herkent. Daarna leggen we in overzichtelijke stappen uit wat je zelf kan doen. Uiteraard geven we ook aan wanneer het verstandig is om toch contact op te nemen met de huisarts of de huisartsenpost, of om 112 te bellen. 

Hulp bij reanimatie
Voor reanimatie biedt de app een gesproken instructie. In twaalf duidelijke stappen begeleidt de app je bij het reanimeren. Hiermee kun je in een stressvolle situatie correct medisch handelen. De instructie kan op elk moment gepauzeerd wordt. Ook is het mogelijk om vanuit het instructiemenu direct 112 te bellen. 

Ook voor bewusteloosheid, hevige bloedingen, brandwonden, vergiftiging en ernstige verslikking is er een gesproken instructie met duidelijke stappen en de mogelijkheid om direct 112 te bellen. 

Let op: De app geeft niet aan waar AED’s hangen.

EHBO-producten en cursussen
In de app vind je een link naar de webshop van het Nederlandse Rode Kruis. We hebben onder andere verschillende EHBO-sets en -koffers, lesboeken en AED’s. In de webshop vind je ook EHBO-cursussen. Er is keuze tussen online introductiecursussen, reanimatiecursussen, uitgebreide cursussen of aanvullende cursussen.

First Aid Kit has simple step-by-step first aid instructions that you can follow when providing emergency help to an injured victim. The emergency help provided can be the difference between life and death. Hence, emergency first aid is an important skill that everyone should have since no one knows when he or she will be required to provide emergency help.  
 
First Aid Kit also has a BMI calculator. The BMI calculator is a scientific calculator used to determine a person's body mass index. To give you your Body Mass Index (BMI), the BMI calculator will require you to provide your height and weight. The BMI calculator will then apply a series of complex formulas to provide height and weight values to come up with an accurate BMI value. The first aid app also provides you with a list of BMI values from the world health organization. The BMI values from the world health organization are categorized as underweight, normal weight, and obese. The world health organization's values are considered to be the conventional world wide standard, hence will help you make informed health and fitness decisions.
 
Besides, First Aid Kit has a medical record section.

In the medical record section, users can update, edit, and delete their profiles at their convenience.
 
 First aid kit is also an important element in emergency first aid. First Aid Kit has some of the common items found in a first aid kit. Most people do not know how to use some of these items, and hence the first aid kit in this app will help educate you on the usage of these tools that will come in handy when you are required to provide emergency first aid. The first aid app also has multiple national emergency phone numbers that you can use when requesting emergency help.
 
 The first aid's app health news and health tips section will provide you, with a variety of healthcare information. Healthcare is an important aspect of human lives, hence First Aid Kit will always provide you with up to date health information. The first aid app is also structured in a way that it can also be used to provide lifesaver first aid courses.

With DMV PRACTICE TEST you get free, state-specific DMV practice tests that are the same as the real test. Practice driving test for all drivers license. 

Pass your 2021 permit test the first time with DMV PRACTICE TEST. Free practice tests, just like the real thing, for all 50 states - Cars, CDL, and Motorcycle licenses.



PRACTICE DMV TESTS MAKE YOU PASS FASTER

A whopping 5 out of 10 people fail the DMV test the first time they take it, but the people that use DMV PRACTICE TEST see a 99% pass rate. We also let you take every sample dmv written test and DMV license test for free as many times as needed so you can be sure you're ready for the real thing.

HOW IT WORKS

• Pass the DMV Test: Once you've practiced enough and are passing the practice exams, you should be ready to make an appointment with the DMV. With a 99% chance of passing, you'll be ready to pass the test the first time!
• Take Comprehensive Practice Tests: Our tests cover every section of the driver's manual so no matter what state you're in, you'll be well prepared. Go through our practice tests and when you take the real thing, it will seem easy.

• No Need for the Driver's Manual: We provide you with the most up-to-date questions based on the current version of your state's official driver's handbook. Don't be surprised with outdated test questions. We cover every DMV, DDS, BMV, MVA, RMV, DOR, MVC, MVD, DOT, DOL in the country.


WHY WE’RE SO EFFECTIVE

• Feel confident as you walk into the DMV: You've seen it all before and know what's coming. You got this!

• Know what to expect: Our tests have the same number of questions and the same passing score requirements as the actual tests so you'll know what to expect.

• Stay motivated to study: With our practice tests you'll learn as you go and see your own progress in real time.



WHY CHOOSE DMV PRACTICE TEST?

• Accurate & Up-to-Date: We constantly monitor the newest versions of your state's official driving handbook and traffic laws and then update our test questions accordingly. They are always accurate and up to date.

• The Same Content: Since we take our facts directly from the handbooks, it allows us to create practice test questions that are very similar, if not identical, to the questions found on the actual driver's license test.

• State-Specific Tests: Because each state has different driving laws and restrictions, we've tailored our tests to each specific state. This isn't one of those generic DMV practice tests.

In an emergency, time and location accuracy are critical. By downloading the ‘Emergency +’ app, you’ll equip yourself with a powerful tool that will help you call Triple Zero (000) quickly, and allow you to accurately communicate your location to emergency call-takers.
 
‘Emergency +’ is a national app developed by Australia’s emergency services and their government industry partners, helping people to call the right number at the right time, anywhere in Australia. Emergency + also includes SES and Police Assistance Line numbers as options, so non-emergency calls are made to the most appropriate number.
 
When calling Triple Zero (000), remember to stay focused, stay relevant and stay on the line. Before you call ask yourself:
 
* Is someone seriously injured or in need of urgent medical help?
* Is your life or property being threatened?
* Have you just witnessed a serious accident or crime?
 
If you answered ‘Yes’ to any of these questions, call Triple Zero (000). Triple Zero (000) calls are free.
 
The app uses a mobile phone’s GPS functionality and what3words, so callers can provide emergency call-takers with their location information as determined by their smart phone.
 
With what3words available within the Emergency+ app, Triple Zero (000) callers can confirm their exact location quickly and accurately.
what3words has divided the world into 3m squares and given each one a unique three word identifier. Addressing using what3words works offline - ideal when you have no data coverage or are in a remote location.

First aid refers to the emergency or immediate care you should provide when a person is injured or ill until full medical treatment is available. For minor conditions, first aid care may be enough. For serious problems, first aid care should be continued until more advanced care becomes available.
First aid is vital for saving lives. A person can carry out first aid after a life-threatening incident or injury before the arrival of emergency services.
The aims of first aid are to preserve life, prevent harm, and promote recovery.
In first aid, ABC stands for airway, breathing, and circulation.
The recovery position helps minimize further injury.
CPR stands for cardiopulmonary resuscitation. It helps maintain the flow of oxygenated blood.
While doing chest compressions, you may hear cracks. This is normal.
First aid is an emergency measure, generally consisting of simple, often life-saving techniques that most people can train to perform with minimal equipment and no previous medical experience.
First aid is not classed as medical treatment and does not replace interventions from a trained medical professional.
At any moment, you or someone around you could experience an injury or illness. Using basic first aid, you may be able to stop a minor mishap from getting worse. In the case of a serious medical emergency, you may even save a life.
First aid covers the steps taken to help an injured or sick person in the first minutes after the event.

Often this first aid can help someone feel better, recover more quickly, and can even save lives.

First aid can be useful in many different situations, from sprains to electric shocks to heart attacks.
First aid might involve a simple action, such as placing a person in the correct position to breathe freely. It might involve a more skilled activity, such as cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) if they have stopped breathing.
The provision of prompt and appropriate first aid can reduce the severity of an injury or illness and in extreme cases, could mean the difference between life and death.
First aid refers to medical attention that is usually administered immediately after the injury occurs and at the location where it occurred. It often consists of a one-time, short-term treatment and requires little technology or training to administer. First aid can include cleaning minor cuts, scrapes, or scratches; treating a minor burn; applying bandages and dressings; the use of non-prescription medicine; draining blisters; removing debris from the eyes; massage; and drinking fluids to relieve heat stress.
First aid can treat all sorts of minor bumps and scrapes, but you should see a doctor for more serious accidents. You may want to think about getting a first aid kit for your house or training in first aid so that you are prepared to deal with minor accidents.
Basic first aid refers to the initial process of assessing and addressing the needs of someone who has been injured or is in physiological distress due to choking, a heart attack, allergic reactions, drugs or other medical emergencies. Basic first aid allows you to quickly determine a person's physical condition and the correct course of treatment. You should always seek professional medical help as soon as you are able, but following correct first aid procedures can be the difference between life and death. Follow our entire tutorial, or find specific advice by checking out the sections listed above.
First aid is the emergency treatment that is given to an injured or sick person or animal, often by someone who does not have medical training. First aid refers to the immediate treatment of an individual(s) that is injured or ill. First aid is not a full medical treatment.","100,000+",4.19,Medical,USD,0.0,True

General nutrition,Nutrition Tracker,https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/O-hqtQAGWtFbPCCsoQ6MevYeEU4cWaNanZdt5HbjHX0tBrVaRV1O8iwtO4l2F7JyEO0,"UNRIVALLED DIETARY INSIGHTS TO FUEL YOUR BEST SELF

Fuelbetter doesn't just help you track calories & basic macros (carbs, fats, and protein). It tracks & measures ALL nutrients important to your health in real-time. This complete, holistic view of your nutrition, combined with Fuelbetter's ground-breaking digital dietitian, empowers you to achieve your dietary, health, and performance goals, whatever they are:

∙ Lasting weight loss

∙ Faster exercise recovery & performance

∙ Pregnancy health

∙ Shifting to a plant-based diet without losing out on important nutrients

∙ Immune system support

∙ & more...

Fuelbetter’s team of software engineers, data scientists, RDs, and sports scientists have spent years developing the proprietary technology that makes the app possible. The end result is revolutionary: FOUR WORLD-FIRST functionalities which can help you take control of your health like never before.

1. PRECISELY CALCULATE YOUR BIOLOGICAL REQUIREMENTS
Fuelbetter calculates your unique nutrient requirements using techniques normally reserved for elite athletes. The one-size-fits-all RDAs (recommended daily allowances) communicated by public health authorities are relevant to hardly any of us. Not only that, but requirements can shift suddenly during moments of life change, such as pregnancy, taking on a new physical challenge, starting a weight loss journey, or going vegan.

Iron is a great example: A woman following a paleo diet who exercises infrequently may have a dietary iron need of 4mg/day, while another woman of the same height and weight but following a vegan diet and training as an endurance runner may need 100mg/day. That’s a big difference – equivalent to the amount of iron in 3.5kg (8 lbs) of spinach!

2. TEST FOR 164 NUTRIENT DEFICIENCIES/EXCESSES
Fuelbetter monitors your nutrient intake throughout the day, compares this to your nutrient requirements, and checks for the presence of any nutritional deficiencies or excesses. Historically, only blood tests could offer this level of insight, at an average cost more than $15/£10 per nutrient. Fuelbetter tests for 164 nutrients in real time, at a fraction of the cost.

3. ON-DEMAND DIGITIAL NUTRITIONIST
Once you’ve identified any problem areas in your diet, Fuelbetter’s powerful digital nutritionist suggests exactly what to eat to hit your nutrient requirements. Rather than complicated new recipes and obscure ingredients, you’ll see meal suggestions based on foods you’re already eating. If you don’t like the first suggestion, just swipe left and to get another suggestion instantly.

4. SEE THE HEALTH & CLIMATE IMPACT OF YOUR CHOICES
Just in case you need any further motivation, Fuelbetter measures the real time impact of your food choices on your immune health, the health of the planet, and your risk of developing type 2 diabetes and other diet-related non-communicable diseases.

We run the world’s largest in-depth nutritional research program, in collaboration with scientists from Harvard University, Mass General Hospital, Stanford University and Kings College London.

PERSONALIZED: 
Our studies show that one-size-fits-all nutrition just doesn't work. So the ZOE program starts with the most comprehensive at-home test available  – analyzing your gut microbiome, blood sugar, and blood fat – to get an accurate picture of your unique biology.

CUTTING EDGE:
The impact of food on your metabolism is more complex than just calories in. Which is why we use the latest developments in machine learning and the microbiome to understand how gut microbes influence your health and weight.

NO FOOD OFF LIMITS: 
We know most of our members have tried other programs in the past. But members tell us that ZOE feels different. You won't count points, calories or macros here and that can feel really liberating. Instead you'll learn what your own body needs and see that playing with your food is actually pretty fun!

SUPPORTED: 
You'll have support and guidance from our ZOE Coaches every step of the way. All our coaches are trained in the ZOE method with a deep understanding of nutrition science. So you're in safe hands.

HOW ZOE WORKS

1. Your body is unique. So we'll start with a comprehensive, easy-to-use, at-home test to understand your biology from all angles – gut microbiome, blood sugar, and blood fat.
2. Our detailed insight reports compare your test results to thousands of other people. Revealing how your body works and which foods will nourish it.
3. You'll then put your insights into action with a personalized program – helping you work towards your health and weight goals with motivating challenges and supporting lessons each week.
4. Finally, make it your own! We know restrictive diets don't work. So with ZOE no food is off limits. You'll use the app to learn how to build great meals and see that with the right combinations your body can have a better response to what you eat and you can avoid dietary inflammation.

Start food journaling today with the #1 Mindful Photo Food Journal — Ate!

With all the distractions and stress in our lives, it's easy to eat mindlessly. Often it’s hard to remember what and why we ate. 

Mindless eating has an impact on health — physical, mental, and emotional. 
Diets and other quick fixes don’t work in the long run. Sometimes they even cause more stress and frustration.

Ate was built with this in mind. It’s a judgement-free mindful diary that is thoughtfully designed to help increase self-awareness of eating habits, behaviors, and feelings. 

Ate is an easy to use food journal built around positive reinforcement. ❤️ It fits easily into life and is a joy to use. Ate reveals existing healthy behaviors and shows how to turn them into healthy habits. Ate also provides guidance on how to turn unhealthy habits into healthy ones. 

Ate worked with health professionals around the world and built this app on journaling techniques that have been proven over decades.

Ate Food Journal is not about crash diets or restrictive living by calorie counting. It’s about building a sustainable and healthy lifestyle. A better version of one’s self, one small habit at a time. One that is easily maintained and enjoyed in the long run. ❤️

We’re for eating what you love with the people you love. 
We’re for keeping the fun and losing the weight. 
We’re for happy hours and healthy habits. 
We’re for weight loss that lasts. 

Ranked the #1 best diet for weight loss 12 years in a row by U.S. News & World Report, we've updated our program to make it easier to follow and find success. Lose weight and keep it off with the science, support, simplicity, and sustainability of our award-winning program.  

Our customized plans are like a nutritionist in your pocket. Unlike some other weight-loss programs, we take a beyond-calorie approach, guiding you toward the most nutritious foods and healthier patterns of eating. 


How WeightWatchers Works
Quick fixes don’t last. WeightWatchers does. Our nutrition and behavior change experts have designed a program that ensures:

Nutrition with no guesswork. We take into account a food’s complex nutritional data—like calories, added sugars, fiber, and protein, as well as saturated fats vs. unsaturated fats—to create a single number: the Points® value. ⁣

Total livability. When you sign up, you’ll get a customized nutrition plan, which includes a number of Points to spend (and track) each day. There are no rules, restrictions, or red-flag foods—just learning how to eat and get to your goals. 

A strong support system. A private members-only social community, 24/7 live coach chat, 5-Minute Coaching audios—we've got it all. 

Motivation to get moving. More activity means more weight loss. Ease into exercise with fun on-demand classes from obé Fitness and simple ways to move more (housework counts!). 

Better sleep. Science shows people who get consistently less sleep are hungrier throughout the day. Learn to get better shut-eye, track your sleep, relax with Breethe meditations, and get 5-Minute Coaching audios to help you de-stress.  

Get the results you want with easy-to-use features on your mobile phone.

Each week you'll have a personalized meal plan with simple & healthy recipes that are catered to your exact needs and preferences.

Eliminate decision fatigue after a long day's work - simply pick a recipe from your meal plan and cook it in less time than it takes to pick up an unhealthy (and expensive) takeout meal.

<b>4. Healthy meal plans that are uniquely your own</b>
With the <u>most personalization options</u> of any minimal-waste meal planner out there, you can cook exactly how you want to eat.
From classic, flexitarian, pescetarian, low carb, paleo, keto, vegetarian & vegan diet types to gluten-free, shellfish free, fish free, dairy free, peanut free, tree nut free, soy free, egg free, sesame free, and mustard free allergy restrictions to 119 individual dislikable ingredients, your meal plans will be truly personalized to your specific needs.

<b>5. Save money with minimal food waste</b>
It's annoying when you purchase ingredients from the grocery store, cook a meal or two, and have a bunch of ingredients going bad by the end of the week, isn't it?

With Mealime, your days of wasting food are over! All meal plans are intelligently created in order to eliminate food waste as much as possible. You'll use up the majority of purchased ingredients if you cook your meal plan each week, saving you hundreds - if not thousands - of dollars per year.

<b>Optional Mealime Pro subscription</b>
Mealime is free to download and use. Should you choose to upgrade to Mealime Meal Planner Pro, we offer an auto-renewing subscription option at a price of $2.99 USD / month.

These recipes make it easy to whip up delicious, healthy, diabetic-friendly meals. For people with diabetes, healthy eating is not simply a matter of what one eats, but also when one eats. Discover delicious, healthy recipes that fit into a diabetic diet. People with diabetes can eat any food that they want, preferably a healthy diet with some carbohydrates, but they need to be more aware of the carbohydrate content of foods and avoid simple sugars like juices and sugar-sweetened beverages.

Whether you’re trying to prevent or control diabetes, your nutritional needs are virtually the same as everyone else, so no special foods are necessary. But you do need to pay attention to some of your food choices, most notably the carbohydrates you eat. While following a heart-healthy diet can help with this, the most important thing you can do is to lose a little weight.

Losing just 5% to 10% of your total weight can help you lower your blood sugar, blood pressure, and cholesterol levels. Losing weight and eating healthier can also have a profound effect on your mood, energy, and sense of well being. Even if you’ve already developed diabetes, it’s not too late to make a positive change. By eating healthier, being more physically active, and losing weight, you can reduce your symptoms or even reverse diabetes. The bottom line is that you have more control over your health than you may think.

Nutrition and physical activity are important parts of a healthy lifestyle when you have diabetes. Along with other benefits, following a healthy meal plan and being active can help you keep your blood glucose level, also called blood sugar, in your target range. To manage your blood glucose, you need to balance what you eat and drink with physical activity and diabetes medicine if you take any.

<b>DIABETIC RECIPES APP EXPERIENCE</b>

This is simple to navigate and also has multiple tutorials available on how to use the app.
As the recipe is a set of instructions for cooking, our app also provides nutritional information, servings, total time for preparation and recommendations so that nothing can go wrong when you’re cooking.

<b>Theme Support</b>

Make your diabetic recipes cooking experience more comfortable at night by enabling dark mode.

<b>Smart shopping list for your diet control</b>

An organized shopping list allows the user to create ingredients list so you won’t miss any for the recipe. Users can also add items directly from recipes. It also has offline access.

<b>Search 1M+ healthy recipes</b>

Apart from shopping list our app also provides a global search feature
where you can find diabetic-friendly recipes you looking for.

<b>Collect your favorite diet</b>

<b>How does Intermittent Fasting work?</b>
Intermittent fasting has been proven to lead to rapid weight loss. When your glycogen is depleted during fasting, your body activates ketosis - the body's ""fat burning mode"". This is an effective way to burn fat.

<b>Is healthy eating & intermittent fasting safe?</b>
Yes. This is the most natural and safest way for weight loss. Studies show that eating continuously prevents the body from taking a break from digestion - and that leads to health problems such as diabetes. When you fast, simply take a break from eating. By doing so, you'll take the strain off your liver.

<b>Is the fasting tracker suitable for me?</b>
The fasting tracker offers different intermittent fasting plans and is suitable for beginners and experienced people as well as for men and women. It guides you through your plan. You don't have to change your diet - it's easy. If you are under 18 years old or pregnant, if you are breastfeeding, suffer from health problems or are underweight, please consult your doctor before fasting.","10,000+",3.9655173,Food & Drink,USD,0.0,True

There is no cure for food allergies, so it is important to recognize and avoid any ingredient that may cause serious allergic reactions or adverse effect on health. The FDA imposed regulation on food manufacturers to include any major food allergens on food labels to help allergic consumers identify offending foods or ingredients. However, there are food products that may have undeclared allergens so consumers must read the ingredients list thoroughly. 
With Alertrak, consumers can take the guesswork out of checking food labels and save time. The app allows consumers to pick their food preferences for ingredients they want to avoid.

***This app is no longer in active development. It is offered ""as is"", and most likely no further updates will be released.***

The heart of the app is a diary in which you can record all the individual food items that you eat for each meal of the day. In addition you can also record any symptoms you experience which may be caused by some of these food items. The exact time and date is recorded for each entry, to build up a comprehensive picture of your diet and symptoms on an hour by hour, day by day basis. Any other information you wish to record can be entered as ""Notes"" in to the diary.

Entering the information is easy because the Intolerance Food Diary remembers every food item, symptom, or note that you enter into the diary, so the next time you come to type in that same information it appears ready to select in a drop down list. This makes filling in the diary much quicker and more reliable.

Once you have recorded a useful amount of data on your food consumption and symptoms, the app is able to perform a statistical analysis on this information and then give an indication of which food items might be the most likely cause of a specific symptom you are experiencing (the app disregards any notes you have entered). In addition you can look for foods which, after consumption, may have either a short or a long ""incubation period"" before causing a noticeable symptom. This can be done by adjusting a simple slider to influence how the statistical analysis looks at the data. It should be noted that the information provided in this app does not constitute medical advice. You should always consult with a medical professional before embarking on any course of action which may affect your health.

The app also allows you to create reports from the data in your food and symptom diary. You can select entries between any two dates, and export the data to a PDF report document or a CSV data file (for use in a spreadsheet). The information can then be emailed to either yourself or the medical professional who is monitoring your diet.

Paying a small fee to upgrade to the premium version of the app removes all the banner adverts, and allows you access to the ""Backup/Restore Diary"" feature. This allows you to backup your entire diary database to a single file, move that file to a new device, and then restore the diary in full to that new device. You can also do the same with your Food Dictionary database which is built up from all the foods you enter into the app. This allows you to carry on using Intolerance Food Diary with a new device.

This app needs certain permissions in order to work correctly. 
-- In App Purchases : This is needed to allow users to upgrade to the premium version of the app. However the free version of the app is still fully functional. The only feature non-premium users will not have access to, is the backup/restore diary function - and this feature is only required if you wish to move your diary to a new device.
-- Photos/Media/Files : Don't worry, the app does not go near any media or files already on your device. The app needs this permission in order to create PDF and CSV reports of your food diary, and to save them on your device in a specific ""IntoleranceFoodDiary"" folder. The app then needs to be able to read these report files so you can attach them to an email. It also needs file system access for the backup/restore feature which saves the whole diary database to a single file located in the same specific folder.
-- Network Access : The app needs network access to load the banner adverts which are displayed in the non-premium version of the app. No other data is received or transmitted by the app other than that required for the banner adverts.

All data entered into this app is stored locally on your device. It is only accessible by you.","50,000+",3.671233,Health & Fitness,USD,0.0,True

With these steps, everyone can enjoy meals and stay safe from an allergic reaction.

Planning meals around food allergens, whether for you or your child, doesn’t have to be complicated and stressful. All it takes is certain kitchen organization tactics and some simple food swaps.

Any food could provoke an allergic reaction, says Matthew Greenhawt, MD, an allergist at the University of Michigan Allergy Clinic and an assistant professor at the division of allergy and immunology with the University of Michigan Health Center in Ann Arbor. But he says eight foods account for 90 percent of food allergies: milk, eggs, fish, shellfish, tree nuts, peanuts, wheat, and soy.

It’s rare, but some people, especially children and young adults, can have a severe, life-threatening allergic reaction (anaphylaxis) if they come in contact with these foods. So you want to keep them not only out of dishes you prepare, but also away from “safe” foods to avoid cross-contamination.

Packing a lunch Free-From the top food allergens is easy with Enjoy Life Foods. All Enjoy Life products are free from wheat, gluten, dairy, peanuts, tree nuts, egg, soy, fish and shellfish, so pack school lunches with confidence.

Food allergies are a defensive response by your immune system to a specific food protein that you may eat. Food allergies are relatively uncommon, affecting 6 – 8% of children and up to 3% of adults, and they can have symptoms that range from mild to life-threatening.But by eliminating trigger foods and caring for your overall well-being, you can successfully deal with your food allergies.
Food allergies can be minor or they can be a major health risk — even deadly. They can cause hives, constipation, diarrhea, bloating, anaphylaxis (closing of throat), or rash. When testing for food allergies, it is important you do not try to diagnose it on your own.

It's hard to know how much or what kind of activity you need to stay healthy. That's why Google Fit collaborated with the World Health Organization (WHO) and the American Heart Association (AHA) to bring you Heart Points, an activity goal that can help improve your health.

Activities that get your heart pumping harder have tremendous health benefits for your heart and mind. You'll earn one Heart Point for each minute of moderate activity like picking up the pace when walking your dog, and double points for more intense activities like running. It takes just 30-minutes of brisk walking five days a week to reach the AHA and WHO's recommended amount of physical activity shown to reduce the risk of heart disease, improve sleep, and increase overall mental wellbeing.

Google Fit will also help you:

TRACK YOUR WORKOUTS FROM YOUR PHONE OR WATCH

Get instant insights when you exercise and see real-time stats for your runs, walks, and bike rides. Fit will use your Android phone's sensors or Wear OS by Google smartwatch's heart rate sensors to record your speed, pace, route, and more.

MONITOR YOUR GOALS

See your daily progress on your Heart Points and Steps goal. Meeting your goals all the time? Easily adjust your goals to keep challenging yourself to achieve a healthy heart and mind.

MAKE ALL YOUR MOVEMENT COUNT

If you walk, run, or bike throughout the day, your Android phone or Wear OS by Google smartwatch will automatically detect and add your activities to your Google Fit journal to ensure you get credit for every move. Want extra credit? Turn up the tempo on your walks by starting a paced walking workout and stepping to the beat. Enjoy a different type of workout? Select it from a list of activities like pilates, rowing, or spinning, and Google Fit will track all the Heart Points you earn.

CONNECT WITH YOUR FAVORITE APPS AND DEVICES

Fit can show you info from many of your favorite apps and devices to give you a holistic view of your health, so you'll never lose track of your progress.

<b>What Our Users Are Saying</b>
• ""This app is absolutely brilliant. It's a very simple no fuss gym tracker. It has all these small features that I keep discovering that keeps me thinking how well it's built. The main features I am extremely thankful for are the ""View last time"" feature per exercise that you can go back in the history quickly and the small little ""Easy, med and hard"" color tags you can tag each set with. There are a bunch of others that the dev did right, thanks so much. I can see there's a lot of thought that went into this and it wasn't just built to build an app! Well done!"" - Bernhard Smuts
• ""This app is phenomenal. The design descions and features are all super intuitive and cater to weightlifting perfectly. One of my favourite things is the way the app handles adding exercises and sets. You can add sets from a preset workout or one by one, and adding custom exercises is a breeze. Every time you add an exercise it prepopulates the sets from your last exercise and there is a quick look button that shows how heavy you went last time you did the exercise. I cannot recommend it enough."" - Sam Mete
• ""I was about to lose my mind trying to find an intuitive, straightforward app to track my workouts. I finally stopped the search with this app. It didn't take long to add previous workouts, and it's so convenient for logging new workouts as well."" - Tara Gordon

The goal of this workout tracker app is to allow you to exercise and log your training results without looking at the phone all the time, with as little screen taps as possible. Both beginners and experienced lifters (in bodybuilding, power lifting or fitness) will benefit from this workout log's simplicity and features which include

★ Custom workout builder

Already have a program you follow? Great. All you have to do is enter exercises, create workout routine(s) - and you're ready to go. New to bodybuilding or powerlifting? This app is for you too. Find a program you like - and copy it into the app, or use our sample routine and modify it to your liking and capabilities. 

- choose workout exercises freely. You don't need to deal with a long list of exercises that you never use in your training. Add exercises that you love and name them in a way that is clear to you;
- import popular exercises for a quick start (as well as a sample routine);
- save training routines with pre-defined exercise selection;
- use dynamic training routines, where you can select exercises on the go.

★ Comments, history and detailed workout information

Want to see if the last set was too hard? Wonder how was your training progress over the period? Our bodybuilding workout log app has got you covered.

- log comments and notes for workout sets;
- log difficulty of a set with one tap;
- you always see history of sets, reps, weight, comments and rest times (no need to interrupt your training to view previous history);
- you can check detailed workout history with a calendar and stats;
- enjoy progress tracking with graphs for 1 rep max;
- easily delete incorrectly logged workout sets;

★ Settings customization

Everyone is different and needs different time for rest, different signals, different information. Choose what works best for you.

- use rest timer with vibration and an optional sound notification, which is extremely useful if you train with headphones;
- check out <b>smart automatic rest interval selection</b>;
- option to show best results from each workout only;
- option to show results from the same routine only;
- formula of 1RM changes;

★ Training results' review

Export your workout results for additional analysis, share your achievements with friends and family on social media - don't be modest. You're doing great! 

- export all workout history to a CSV file on the SD card; CSV files can be opened and processed with most spreadsheet editors;
- check your summary of achievements displayed after training (including new records, - <b>total weight moved</b>, training time, intensity);
- share summary screens (Facebook, email, SMS or any other sharing provider that is installed on your phone)

★ Saving your time during training

We all hate to be interrupted. Even more - by having to stop to make small edits to workout program. No need to do this anymore! With Bodybuilding Workout Log your phone screen is always active and edits to exercise routine are easy to make while training hard:

- resume incomplete workouts;
- <b>perform supersets</b> using back/forward navigation or more conveniently using the PRO version supersets feature;
- use smart pre-entering of weight for the next set;
- add/remove/reorder exercises during training

★ Your data is safe

Backup and restore of all exercises and training log history. You can move all saved information to another device at any time.

The peculiarity of quick yoga asanas is that it affects all body systems, normalizes health, creates an excellent physical shape. The principle of hatha daily basic yoga for beginners app is based on the harmonious balanced development of all the muscles of the body, creating balance, endurance with flexibility. The difference between easy yoga classes at home and cardio training is that due to special postures (asana), the body begins to work independently, engage and develop the right muscles. This happens very harmoniously. Isn't great to become healthy in such a way?

Every daily workout has an increasing level of difficulty. You starts with the easiest personal lessons and steps. Fix your results. Later the difficulty level would gradually increase. Asanas yoga flexibility training for beginners is divided into two categories: static and dynamic with video. During training smoothly replace each other. They are suitable for men, women and even seniors.

For complete beginner, it could be a surprise at a large number of poses. Do not worry that you do not know how all the poses are called. 5 min yoga routine workout is a long process.

They certainly brings benefits in the future. Day by day you have progress, the results improves. Over time, you would definitely do more complex lessons with the beginners yoga trainer at home. This would be a great cardio load too.

Test yourself. Take 30 day yoga challenge for one person - the results would definitely come!

Weight training,Weight Training for Women,https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/J3_Yzia7zJs7HRfEBkfZCv1VDx6HXgwtF6sHA-eP8FhkY3GzlGciu10fAEgRlftkNQ,"Weight lifting isn't just for men. It's a myth that lifting weights will make women bulky or put them at risk of injury. Women can excel at weight lifting and experience major physical and mental benefits from strength training, including a leaner, more muscular body as well as better self-esteem.

Our workout programs are designed to get you leaner and stronger with minimal cardio and a lot of picking up and putting down heavy stuff – otherwise known as strength training. If you're looking to lose weight or just maintain your physique, try cutting back on cardio for a few weeks to focus on these strength training exercises for women that increase metabolism and build lean muscle.

We don’t mean bodyweight strength training. We mean building up to use dumbbells, a barbell, free weights, and kettlebells. That’s right, I’m talking about dominating that section of the gym. Strength training is one of the most rewarding skills one can master with just a few simple and extremely functional movements. 

Lifting weights two to three times per week is extremely beneficial for women to reduce their risk of osteoporosis by promoting bone health. Between the ages of 30 and 70, muscle mass and strength decrease by an average of 30%, mostly due to inactivity. Weight training can prevent or even reverse this process and, in turn, provides the following benefits: improved performance of physical activities, prevention and management of chronic diseases, improved joint health, prevention and treatment of low-back pain, injury prevention, relief of aches and pains from stress or after prolonged sitting, improved posture, and improved quality of sleep.

<b>How to Start Lifting Weights: A Beginner's Guide</b>
Whether your goal is to build muscle mass or achieve a fitter, more toned body, weight training can help you get there. Weight training, also known as resistance or strength training, builds lean, stronger muscles, strengthens your bones and joints, and even helps boost your metabolism. This means you’ll burn more calories even when you’re resting.

Stronger muscles can also improve your athletic performance and reduce your chance of injuries. Even if you’ve never done any kind of weight training before, it’s never too late to start. Strength training is appropriate for both men and women, and it can be started at any age or fitness level.

You don’t need to be a fitness buff. In fact, you don’t even need to belong to a gym. You can simply use your body weight for many exercises or use free weights, dumbbells, barbell, resistance bands, or other home fitness equipment to get results.

This app will walk you through how to get started with weight training and provide suggested exercises and training advice (plus 30 day programs!) for beginners.","50,000+",3.7142856,Health & Fitness,USD,0.0,True

Strength training doesn’t just help you get strong and feel sturdy. It's also good for heart health, can lower cholesterol, help with posture and keep your metabolism ticking over as muscle tissue is more metabolically active than fatty tissue. This means your body will burn more energy at rest the more muscle tissue you have.

Although strength training can get your heart pumping when you’re new to it or when you start lifting heavy, you’ll find the rest periods between sets and the focus required can actually help you to be more mindful and feel less stressed.

In this app, we’ll be taking you on the journey from plucking up the courage to enter the weights room in the first place to all the lingo you need to learn. Strength can be built daily, from using your own bodyweight to progressing into using kettlebells, dumbbells and all the kit in the gym. You will see the biggest development within the first few weeks as your body adapts to new stimuli.

Build muscle at home or in the gym with our 30-day workout routines. When done with good form, dumbbell exercises are among the simplest and best weight exercises we can do for our bodies. An easy way to start or develop your strength training, dumbbell workouts can help build and sculpt muscle throughout your whole body. Using dumbbell exercises, good technique and progressively increasing how hard you're working, you will hundy p get stronger.

While the humble dumbbell is often overlooked in favour of the kettlebell or barbell, experts say they can be just as effective at building strength. Whether you're getting busy with a gym workout and want a refresher on the best dumbbell exercises to do or you're giving the home gym equipment some use in between meetings, this round-up is for you.

The mixing of static and dynamic splits helps you <b>improve flexibility</b> effectively and achieve results faster than you think. With about <b>10 min a day</b>, you’ll get closer and closer to the floor!

Productive stretches for splits in 30 days are suitable for men and women, adults and kids. You can customize your splits training based on your own preferences, <b>no equipment</b> needed.

Whether you want to do a full split for dance, ballet, gymnastics or martial arts, this training will help you get there.

<b>Why splits</b>?
Splits have been proven to prevent injuries, increase muscle strength, relieve muscle stiffness and give you better circulation.

<b>Improve your flexibility & balance</b>
Flexibility and balance are key to reducing the risk of injury during exercise. Splits stretch all your lower body muscles to increase your range of motion.

<b>Loosen your hip flexors</b>
Due to sitting at a desk all day, most people have extremely tight hip flexors, which can cause pain, especially in your lower back. Splits open up these areas to relieve your muscle tension.

<b>Deeply stretch your legs</b>
When doing splits, your legs will be stretching the whole time. Doctors will recommend splits as part of your exercise routine, especially if you’re doing activities such as running or biking.

<b>Boost your circulation</b>
Splits lengthen your muscles and improve your circulation by increasing blood flow to your muscles.

Please get your muscles warmed up before doing the splits. Splits need time; your muscles need time to stretch, recover and adapt to the new demands. Be patient, and stick to it; you’ll soon see progress.

Nowadays people often have low activity levels and sedentary lifestyle, so to do flexibility stretches pre and post-workout is very important for anyone. All stretching exercises for beginners were selected to develop the elasticity of the body and do not require any additional equipment.

Stretches for flexibility
The daily stretch workout is suitable for all groups of people. There are 60 different routines to do flexibility training for beginners, and all of them have detailed video and text instructions. Just follow the instructions of the virtual instructor

Everyday morning warm-up
What could be better than a charge of vivacity and energy in the morning? Just do a workout and see how your health gets better and better every morning. In addition, the morning flexible workout has a great influence on mood throughout the day and overall vitality. Flexibility training for beginners, for gymnastics, for men and women has 3 different programs and over 50 different workouts during which you can do the full-body training.

Warm-up
Before performing any physical exertion, for example, when running or when visiting the gym and pool, all muscles must be prepared and heated. The warm-up will allow you to do stretches to improve leg flexibility and to prepare the muscles and avoid their overtraining, possible injury and damage. 

Muscle tension and pain relief
Muscular tension - constantly increased muscle tone when it is impossible to fully relax them. The specially designed training system will get rid of muscle cramps and blocks. What makes this happen? In carrying out the sports activity, there is an increase in the local blood flow, especially in the muscles and ligaments, due to which the local metabolism and metabolic processes are enhanced. So, if you have flexible muscles - everything will be ok. Do the upper and lower body, leg stretch, shoulder stretching exercises for beginners.

Application functionality:
✓ 60 different stretching exercises for beginners for the full body of different levels of complexity and for all muscle groups;
✓ Each stretch routine contains detailed audio, text instructions and videos of their implementation;
✓ 3 training programs are provided and prepared for stretch workout for every day, you can also create your own workouts, set the level of difficulty and length, also every program has different stretch plan and different difficulty – Basic program is the best choice for the beginners, 7 minute or 10 minute stretch exercises – is for everyday stretching workout;
✓ We've created a special motivation system that will keep track of your results and motivate to achieve more and more;
✓ You can create your own programs for leg flexibility stretches for beginners, for runners;
✓ Notifications system - Now, you will never forget to do stretch fitness;
✓ Detailed statistics – make a 30-day challenge and track your results and your progress.

We use a special system to test our elasticity. To do this, we offer to regularly measure our indicators:
1) The distance from the fingertips to the floor when tilted forward - characterizes the general condition of the spine and its health. Just do flexible stretches for men and women, even for runners and the results will come!
2) The distance from the center of the palm to the level of the knee when tilting sideways from a standing position - here is the condition and elasticity of the back and waist when tilting.
3) The distance to the floor from the position when the person sits on the splits - if the muscles of the legs are clamped and their elasticity is missing, then this is a very difficult task.

⭐ The main task of this app is not only to do body flexibility training for beginners, men & women, for gymnastics, - but to create a stable habit of regular stretch exercises in the context of life.","1,000,000+",4.53,Health & Fitness,USD,0.0,True

And ensuring that you have equal flexibility on both sides might help protect you from injury. Stretching can also reduce pain from chronic conditions, such as osteoarthritis and lower back pain.
It is a crucial part of a regular workout regimen because stretching after a workout routine relaxes tightened muscles. You can improve flexibility of specific muscles as well as the entire body with our simple exercises. 

It may seem basic, but better mobility and incorporating mobility workouts into your routine may be the secret sauce for improving your overall health and fitness. Just as you train for aerobic endurance, strength and flexibility, you also need to train for mobility, especially if you want to maintain a vibrant, active life. 

Flexibility is integral to a healthy and mobile body. Flexible muscles allow you to perform better in your daily activities and reduce risk of injury. Bad posture is one of the best incentives to stretch. If you fix alignment your body will move better and feel better. Your workouts will become more effective because you will now easily access the correct muscles needed to optimize training. The app includes multiple 8-week stretch programs that will help you to drastically improve your flexibility. Flexibility isn’t a goal with a clear beginning and end — it needs to be integrated into your routine every day. But for someone that doesn’t usually stretch and wanting to see improvement, a stretch workout per day is the sweet spot to see real change in eight weeks. 

How To Do The Splits Without Hurting Yourself In Just A Few Weeks?

Incorporating some stretching exercises into your workout schedule will help you improve flexibility, reduce tightness, and ultimately, make your workouts more efficient and safe. Stretching is important, yet often most neglected part of the fitness. Not only while working out, but you should also include stretching and flexibility exercises into your daily routine. Avoiding stretching may result in increased soreness and fatigue. 

A full-body stretching routine can help you unfold and improve body alignment. Stretching a muscle temporarily relaxes it and allows it to lengthen. Common logic dictates that a good stretching routine paired with an appropriate warm up and cool down before and after activity and can be an effective way to prevent injuries. For a full body routine from head to toe, roll out a yoga mat and try these stretches.

Gently lean into each position and observe which ones feel particularly challenging.  Flexibility plays a more important role in our well-being than we may realize. Experts believe that good flexibility helps you to achieve better results in your training, increases mobility and muscle coordination, reduces muscle pain, and prevents injuries.

- Improve your joint range of motion
- Improve your athletic performance

We added the best stretches for beginners for warm-up, cooldown, and everyday flexibility. Flexibility is related to muscle tension and length, and it’s a component of mobility, which is the degree to which you can move a joint through its full range of motion. By incorporating a stretching program into your daily routine, you can increase your flexibility and range of motion. You can also improve performance in sports and daily tasks. Stretching can help prevent injury and decrease pain associated with muscle tightness.","10,000+",0.0,Health & Fitness,USD,0.0,True

Stretching may not be the most exciting part of working out, but doing flexibility work is just as important for a well-rounded fitness routine as strength and cardio work. Incorporating some stretching exercises into your workout schedule will help you improve flexibility, reduce tightness, and ultimately, make your workouts more efficient and safe.
Tight muscles can cause undue strain on the neighboring joints during normal daily function, or they themselves can become injured,"" Sasha Cyrelson, D.P.T., clinical director at Professional Physical Therapy in Sicklerville, New Jersey, tells SELF. As we age, our muscles get shorter and less elastic, she adds. ""We need to take an active role in maintaining and improving the length of our muscles so we can continue to enjoy our abilities without pain.
Standing Hamstring Stretch.
Stand tall with your feet hip-width apart, knees slightly bent, arms by your sides.Exhale as you bend forward at the hips, lowering your head toward floor, while keeping your head, neck and shoulders relaxed.Wrap your arms around backs of your legs and hold anywhere from 45 seconds to two minutes.Bend your knees and roll up when you're done.
Piriformis Stretch

The piriformis muscle is a deep internal hip rotator, located on the outside of the butt. Its primary role is external rotation, Atkins says. ""Deep internal rotators, while small, produce a lot of the movement at the hip and are often overlooked.Since the piriformis crosses over the sciatic nerve, ""if it is tight, it can result in sciatic nerve irritation, Cyrelson says. Stretching this muscle can prevent potential future sciatica, or help treat it.
Lunge With Spinal Twist

Atkins notes that this stretch is commonly referred to as the World's Greatest Stretch (WGS) in the fitness community. And for good reason: ""It's essential to help with posture-related pain or for people who sit for prolonged periods of time,"" says Dan Giordano, D.P.T., C.S.C.S., cofounder of Bespoke Treatments Physical Therapy in New York City and Seattle. ""It helps open your hips and improve thoracic (mid-back) mobility,"" he tells SELF.
Figure Four Stretch

""This specifically stretches the piriformis and iliopsoas muscles (essentially your hip rotator and flexor muscles) and the IT band. Because of this and the passive nature of the pose, it is an excellent and gentle approach to helping relieve symptoms associated with sciatica and knee pain,"" John Murray, yoga instructor and co-founder of Lyons Den Power Yoga, tells SELF.
90/90 Stretch

This modification of pigeon pose helps with internal rotation of one leg and external rotation of the other, ""so you're hitting both movements of the hip at once,"" Atkins says. It's a good option for people who have extremely tight hip flexors, she adds. ""The front thigh is safely on the ground in a position that doesn't cause too much stress.""
Frog Stretch

""Most of us sit and cross our legs, which can lead to tight hips and result in lower-back pain,"" Lacee Lazoff, a NASM-certified personal trainer and instructor at the Fhitting Room in New York City, tells SELF. ""This stretch directly target tights spots in the hips/groin and is especially useful for runners.""","100,000+",4.03125,Health & Fitness,USD,0.0,True
