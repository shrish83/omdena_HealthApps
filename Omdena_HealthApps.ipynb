Voice can be your mental guide, a source of motivation, and an aid in making important life decisions.\\r\\n\\r\\nYou no longer have to struggle to focus when meditating. Let yourself go and allow your imagination to run wild! You'll get all the effects of meditation without actually having to meditate.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<b>EASIER THAN MEDITATION. FASTER RESULTS</b>\\r\\n\\r\\n- Your past experiences don't matter. Even if you're brand new to this, you'll still see progress in just 8 minutes.\\r\\n\\r\\n- You don't need to focus hard on your breathing or be in a certain pose. All you need is to sit down, close your eyes, plug in your earphones, and start listening. We'll take care of the rest.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<b>HYPNOTELLING: OUR SECRET WEAPON</b>\\r\\n\\r\\nWe like to believe we make all our decisions rationally, but that's not exactly true. Most of the time, we're driven by emotions we don't fully understand or can't entirely control.\\r\\n\\r\\nLuckily, your subconscious mind can give you all the things you need. You just need to speak its language - images, sensations etc.\\r\\n\\r\\nYour subconscious mind is like a monkey: it doesn't understand words, but it understands visual information, and remembers emotions. Once you understand this, you can tune it to your liking. Voice allows you to connect to your subconscious mind. It teaches, it heals, it helps to calm down and regain your strength.\\r\\n\\r\\nFor example, it won't only help you deal with anxiety, sleep problems, or burnout, but will also help get to the root of your problems and the reason behind their symptoms, so you can feel calm, inspired, and motivated again.\\r\\nYou become the main character of an exciting adventure story. It's sort of like embarking on a psychological quest in a dreamlike state. You move through a story, face challenges along the way, and learn how to tackle them.\\r\\n\\r\\nUnlike meditation, our stories help keep your brain alert and conscious. It enters a trance-like state where it absorbs information more effectively, giving you faster results. The closest thing it can be compared to is affirmations. You'll notice relaxation and motivation as quick as 8 minutes story.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<b>BASED ON RESEARCH-BACKED TECHNIQUES</b>\\r\\n\\r\\nHypnotelling is based on a method that has been used for athlete training, supportive therapy, psychotherapy, and for scientific research.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<b>HYPNOTELLING EFFECTIVELY HELPS</b>\\r\\n\\r\\n- lower anxiety and stress levels\\r\\n- get you to sleep faster without meditation, and improve your sleeping habits\\r\\n- boost your energy\\r\\n- increase self-motivation\\r\\n- improve mental health\\r\\n\\r\\nMeditation help you develop mindfulness, but it's a slow and difficult process that can be hard to navigate on your own. Voice is like meditation 2.0: it not only allows you to expand your consciousness, but also helps you apply this experience and take action today, tomorrow, and forever. And the best thing is, you'll acquire beneficial mental skills that will stay with you for the rest of your life!\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<b>EMBARK ON YOUR ADVENTURE WITH VOICE TODAY</b>\\r\\n\\r\\nSend your suggestions and questions to help@voice-stories.app\\r\\n\\r\\nUser terms and conditions: https://voice-stories.app/#popup-terms\",\n",

The centerpiece of cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) is learning to identify negative and distorted thinking patterns to change your emotions and your behaviors for the better. In CBT, a \"thought record\" guides you through the steps of identifying, challenging, and reinterpreting negative thinking patterns. With Thought Diary, you can document your negative emotions, analyze flaws in your thinking, and re-evaluate your negative thoughts into more balanced ones. It may even help you recognize helpful ways to deal with your negative behaviors and emotions for future situations.\\r\\n\\r\\nCBT Thought Diary can do more than thought records, though! It can also be used as a daily mood tracker. You can even practice gratitude by creating positive entries using our flexible diary entry format. According to positive psychology, appreciating the positives in our lives can improve happiness and meaning.\\r\\n\\xa0\\r\\nWith CBT Thought Diary, you can gradually change your approach to how you interpret the ups and downs of life, making long-lasting changes in your mental well-being.\\r\\n\\r\\nAccording to positive psychology, practicing gratitude and recording positive emotions is important as well. Thought Diary also allows you to keep track of your positive experiences so that you can refer back to them and appreciate the good moments, as well as note down what particular things you\\'re grateful for. This way, you can be more aware and thankful of the positive moments in life.\\r\\n\\r\\nThought Diary will help you evaluate, understand, and change your thoughts and feelings. By using this application, you can work to identify your emotions, analyze how and why you\\'re feeling this way, challenge those negative beliefs, change your thinking patterns for future situations, and remember positive experiences. You can use this app as a mood journal, a thought record journal, and a gratitude journal.\\r\\n\\r\\nThought Records and Gratitude Journals similar to this app are commonly used in paper form in traditional cognitive-behavioral therapy for a variety of mental health disorders such as clinical depression and anxiety.

The thing that matters is how you interact with these emotions because even when you are happy you need to be able to let go of this happiness and not try to prolong it artificially because there will be consequences. Meditation is a perfect solution to this. It will help you to relax and calm down. Freeing yourself from emotions and thoughts is an important skill that we need to master. Also, a good tool for this is simple sleep because sleep is like a small natural meditation that will lift some stress and let you rest. After sleep you are renewed, everything seems less scary and more possible. There is one more common thing in these two states. The thing is that they are not so easy to attain. Meditation asks from you concentration, proper breathing techniques, and a clear mind at the same time. Sleep is supposed to have good quality and be healthy. Sounds hard, isn‚Äôt it?

After a lecture about how to start to meditate, you can immediately jump to proper composition, the sound of nature, or mantra and begin practice. That way you will gain as much profit as possible. While you are heading somewhere by taxi or by bus you can turn on music for concentration and read articles that we gathered. This will allow us to absorb and understand information better. Akamu is a versatile free app that helps you not only with things we mentioned before, but while you practice them passively you will become more relaxed, and more open-minded, but you will also begin to understand yourself better, and it will be easier for you to go through stressful situations, anxiety will slowly disappear from your life. Our goal is not just to teach you how to meditate or improve your sleep, we want to give you the possibility to have a spiritual journey whenever you need/want to.\\r\\nSo, let‚Äôs sum up what our app has:\\r\\nCourses and lectures that will teach you meditation and not only\\r\\nPractices of mindfulness so you would understand yourself better\\r\\nSounds of nature and music for different purposes like concentrating or meditating\\r\\nSleep practices to improve its quality\\r\\nSpiritual improvement, calmness, and relaxation are things that will come after you use our app for some period of time\\r\\nAkamu is a place where you can improve spiritually. Essential knowledge of how to become better in form that is easy to understand even for somebody who is new at this. Akamu free app is your pocket guide in your spiritual journey.\",\n",

And you‚Äôll hear from historic voices like Alan Watts.\\r\\n \\r\\nBut we also pressure-test ancient wisdom against modern science, so you won‚Äôt find outlandish claims or anything we haven‚Äôt found to be empirically true.\\r\\n \\r\\n**A comprehensive guide\\r\\nWaking Up supports your growth and development in a number of different ways. You‚Äôll find an abundance of useful features, like meditation timers, in-app support messages, an ever-growing audio library, and daily reminders to help bring your mindfulness practice into your life.\\r\\n \\r\\n‚ÄúWaking Up is, hands down, the most important meditation guide I‚Äôve ever used.‚Äù Physician Peter Attia\\r\\n \\r\\n‚ÄúIf you‚Äôve had trouble getting into meditation, this app is your answer!‚Äù -Susan Cain, best-selling author\\r\\n \\r\\n‚ÄúWaking Up is not an app, it‚Äôs a path.

GO EFT Tapping is a perfect tool to get rid of limiting beliefs.\\r\\n\\r\\nLet EFT (Emotional Freedom Technique) become a habit and you will end up with a powerful tool, always on and literally at your fingertips. üñêÔ∏è\\r\\n\\r\\nTry it on anything, as Nick and Jessica Ortner use to say. \\r\\nAllow yourself to be curious and persistent!\\r\\n\\r\\nTry it on your physical problems, too.

His PhD Thesis was made at Clinical Psychology, Division of Psychiatry and Applied Psychology, School of Medicine at The University of Nottingham, United Kingdom. The thesis compared EFT tapping to other psychological interventions for stress and trauma. Dr. Al-Hadethe wanted to spread the EFT tapping across the Arabic speaking world, where professional psychological support often is a scarce or very expensive resource.

It may even help you recognize helpful ways to deal with your negative behaviors and emotions for future situations.\\r\\n\\r\\nCBT Thought Diary can do more than thought records, though!

Thought Diary also allows you to keep track of your positive experiences so that you can refer back to them and appreciate the good moments, as well as note down what particular things you\\'re grateful for. This way, you can be more aware and thankful of the positive moments in life.\\r\\n\\r\\nThought Diary will help you evaluate, understand, and change your thoughts and feelings.

What you do know is that you want to do something about it.\\r\\n\\r\\nSo where do you begin?\\r\\n\\r\\n<b>Enter the world of MoodSpace</b>\\r\\nMoodSpace brings together techniques from cognitive behavioural therapy, mindfulness based cognitive therapy, positive psychology, and behavioural activation into a self-help space for mental wellbeing to guide you in managing and improving your mental health.\\r\\nTechniques such as recognising three good things in a gratitude journal and balancing automatic thoughts in the cbt thought record are grounded in decades of research on what makes us happy.\\r\\n\\r\\n<i>Three Clouds</i> \\r\\nNotice life's good moments by writing a delightful three good things in a gratitude journal and note the good things that are all too often forgotten.\\r\\n\\r\\nThree Clouds is based on the gratitude journal from Positive Psychotherapy. By writing three good things each day the aim is to reduce worry, improve self-esteem, help cope with stress, and more.\\r\\n\\r\\n<i>Thought Diary</i> \\r\\nLook at stressful situations in a healthy, balanced way. Prevent rumination by using the thought record to challenge automatic thinking and gain a new understanding of stressful situations.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe thought dairy (or thought record) is a tool used in CBT to reframe thinking. By analysing thinking patterns in the cbt thought record it helps you to recognise and balance unhelpful thought patterns.\\r\\n\\r\\n<i>Guided Meditation</i>\\r\\nFocus on your breath, re-focus, and become more mindful by learning to meditate. Take your first steps into mindfulness by listening to a selection of guided meditations. Or use the custom meditation timer with a selection of calming nature sounds. Cultivating this sense of mindfulness can help prevent rumination and help cope with stress. \\r\\n\\r\\n<i>Day Planner</i>\\r\\nSchedule your time in this activity planner based on what brings you fulfilment. Rediscover what brings you happiness and make the plans that bring those things back into your life. Ensure your life has balance by making plans around work, fun, and rest to help reduce stress.\\r\\n\\r\\n<b>At your fingertips</b>\\r\\nMoodSpace techniques are designed to be as simple as possible to use.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe three good things technique can be used daily to keep track of the little things.

To quickly cope with stress and get back on with your day.\\r\\n\\r\\n<b>A wellbeing app driven by the research</b>\\r\\n\\r\\nIf you suffer from anxiety or depression, you are far from being alone: It has been estimated that today, there are over 260 million people around the world dealing with depression and 280 million dealing with anxiety. \\r\\n\\r\\nMoodSpace takes its techniques from decades of research on what helps in dealing with anxiety and dealing with depression, and brings those techniques to your fingertips.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe app aims to create a self-help space where you will have the opportunity to experiment with techniques backed by research to see what works for you. \\r\\n\\r\\nUsing this knowledge, we encourage you to carry out your own, further research into your favourite techniques. Your continued learning can build the coping strategies which enable you to cope with stress and manage low mood\\r\\n\\r\\nThe information to bring you happiness is out there but therapy is all too often prohibitively expensive or inaccessible. We think everyone should have access to these tools. \\r\\n\\r\\nYou will never be alone, and we hope this app will provide the self-help tools which guide you to a happier life.\\r\\n\\r\\n----------\\r\\n\\r\\nMoodSpace isn't a replacement for therapy or treatment ‚Äì it's simply an introduction to mental wellbeing techniques and provides a self-help space to learn about yourself.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe always recommend you speak to your doctor to access the treatment available to you.\",\n",

Many people, including many teens, have suffered in this way. A\\r\\ndepressed person:\\r\\n^ has much less energy to do activities\\r\\n^ feels like nothing matters.\\r\\n^ sees life in a negative way.\\r\\n^ feels like it will never get better\\r\\nBut depressed people do get better and depression does end. There are effective\\r\\ntreatments and self-help skills to deal with depression. Health care professionals give\\r\\ndepression treatments, but you can learn self help skills and apply them to your own life. This guide teaches a set of antidepressant skills you can use to overcome depression. Sometimes the skills can be used on their own, when the depression\\r\\nisn‚Äôt too severe. Sometimes they have to be used along with treatments by professionals.\\r\\nDealing with Depression is meant for those who have been coping with depressed mood. Some of the things in this guide will make more sense to younger teens and some will make more sense to older ones. But check it out for yourself. Decide which parts of this guide make sense for your life.\\r\\nThis Depression Test is designed to help you evaluate the severity of your depression with just nine simple questions. This app uses the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9), an empirically-based, self-test questionnaire. Clinical depression is a mood disorder in which feelings of sadness, loss, anger, or frustration interfere with everyday life for weeks or longer. Clinical depression generally responds positively to treatment, so it is important to seek treatment if you are concerned about your mental health.\\r\\n DISCLAIMER: This self-test is not meant to be a diagnosis for your depression. Remember that this app should not be used as a replacement for professional treatment or guidance.\\r\\nDo you suffer from depression? Depression may stem from a personal tragedy or from sad unexpected events or circumstances. It does not discriminate its victims. Depression can affect anyone regardless of their background, race, age, income, etc.\\r\\nThe natural management of depression involves understanding depression and the factors that contribute to the symptoms. Learning to manage stress in your life and engage in self-care behaviors can improve your symptoms and your mood.\\r\\nDepression is one of the most prevalent and treatable mental disorders. Diagnosis of depression is based on the presence of certain symptoms that significantly impair function for a certain duration. These symptoms are described in the DSM-IV, the diagnostic manual for mental disorders. \\r\\nThis app is designed to help with Depression treatment and controlling stress by advising mood enhancing foods, teaching the importance of writing wellness journals and how to get adequate sleep during depressive episodes.\\r\\nDealing with Depression app is an app that helps you diagnose the level of depression you have, and based on that it gives you the suitable solution for your depression level, in some cases depression is only a result of anxiety and some passing problems, but if the person did not get out of that condition then his condition might advance, we will give you some ways to avoid the advancement of your situation, if the depression is severe we will guide you to what to do as soon as possible\\r\\nDepression is common but many people don\\'t admit to it. Some people feel there is a stigma attached, or that people will think they are weak. Great leaders such as Winston Churchill have had depression. Depression is one of the most common illnesses that GPs deal with. People with depression may be told by others to \"pull their socks up\" or \"snap out of it\". The truth is, they cannot and such comments by others are very unhelpful.\\r\\nDepression (major depressive disorder) is a common and serious medical illness that negatively affects how you feel, the way you think and how you act. Fortunately, it is also treatable. Depression causes feelings of sadness and/or a loss of interest.',\n",

The centerpiece of cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) is learning to identify negative and distorted thinking patterns to change your emotions and your behaviors for the better. In CBT, a \"thought record\" guides you through the steps of identifying, challenging, and reinterpreting negative thinking patterns. With Thought Diary, you can document your negative emotions, analyze flaws in your thinking, and re-evaluate your negative thoughts into more balanced ones. It may even help you recognize helpful ways to deal with your negative behaviors and emotions for future situations.\\r\\n\\r\\nCBT Thought Diary can do more than thought records, though! It can also be used as a daily mood tracker. You can even practice gratitude by creating positive entries using our flexible diary entry format. According to positive psychology, appreciating the positives in our lives can improve happiness and meaning.\\r\\n\\xa0\\r\\nWith CBT Thought Diary, you can gradually change your approach to how you interpret the ups and downs of life, making long-lasting changes in your mental well-being.\\r\\n\\r\\nAccording to positive psychology, practicing gratitude and recording positive emotions is important as well. Thought Diary also allows you to keep track of your positive experiences so that you can refer back to them and appreciate the good moments, as well as note down what particular things you\\'re grateful for. This way, you can be more aware and thankful of the positive moments in life.\\r\\n\\r\\nThought Diary will help you evaluate, understand, and change your thoughts and feelings. By using this application, you can work to identify your emotions, analyze how and why you\\'re feeling this way, challenge those negative beliefs, change your thinking patterns for future situations, and remember positive experiences. You can use this app as a mood journal, a thought record journal, and a gratitude journal.\\r\\n\\r\\nThought Records and Gratitude Journals similar to this app are commonly used in paper form in traditional cognitive-behavioral therapy for a variety of mental health disorders such as clinical depression and anxiety. If you are suffering from a mental health disorder, please consult a mental health professional or healthcare provider. \\r\\n\\r\\nPrivacy Policy: https://cbtthoughtdiary.com/privacypolicy\\r\\n\\r\\nTerms Of Service: https://cbtthoughtdiary.com/termsofservice',\n",

              "   'Description': 'Anxiety Release based on EMDR shows you how to release anxious thoughts and feelings naturally, by harnessing the power of your brain. It does this by combining guided instructions and focused attention with bilateral brain stimulation. Bilateral stimulation is a treatment element of EMDR (Eye Movement Desensitization & Reprocessing), a revolutionary treatment which is based on the use of sensory stimulation to alter anxiety-provoking memories and responses. Over 30 randomized controlled studies of EMDR attest to the efficacy of this process.  The author also has two research studies in submission with peer-reviewed scientific journals based on this process.\\r\\n\\r\\nBecause bilateral stimulation appeals to the unconscious, sensing part of the brain, there is no need for effortful thinking or struggling with feelings. All you have to do is LISTEN and your brain will do the rest! The App consists of; \\r\\n1 x brain training session \\r\\n2 x guided anxiety management sessions \\r\\n1 x pure bilateral stimulation session (audio & visual) \\r\\n1 x safe place exercise \\r\\nProgress Log function with prompts\\r\\nPowerful Bls brain visual simulating brain activity associated with anxiety reduction\\r\\n\\r\\nThis App is suitable for both clinicians and the general public.  However, persons suffering with complex PTSD or mental health problems, multiple psychological trauma or unstable neurological conditions (eg; epilepsy) should not use this product without medical supervision.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis app has been tested on Galaxy tab 2, Galaxy S4, and Google Nexus 7.',\n",

There are a lot of things that may set off or contribute to anger, like the actions of another individual, an event, tension, expectations not being met, feeling hurt, contempt, humiliation, embarrassment, jealousy and sorrow.\\r\\n\\r\\nDepending upon how it's dealt with and expressed, anger may be favorable or damaging. It has favorable effects when angry feelings help you address an issue or subject with yourself or a different individual and correct the situation.\\r\\n\\r\\nHandling anger positively enables you to put damaging emotions into perspective. When you wish to let off steam, feel frustrated or distressed, there are constructive methods to channel your anger like listening to music or going to gym. These are frequently utilized in treating anger disorders.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut, expressing anger in a negative way frequently leads to assorted unhealthy behaviors like violence and aggression. You might get out of control and threatening to other people. When anger interferes with your power to think or act clearly, this may cause you to receive unnecessary trouble.\",\n",

Learning to control your depression often depends, in part, on how you can control your anger.\\r\\n\\r\\nHow anger management quotes can help you?\\r\\n\\r\\nYou might think that venting your anger is healthy, that the people around you are too sensitive, that your anger is justified, or that you need to show your fury to get respect. But the truth is that anger is much more likely to damage your relationships, impair your judgment, get in the way of success, and have a negative impact on the way people see you. That‚Äôs where anger management comes in.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe goal of anger management?\\r\\n\\r\\nMany people think that anger management is about learning to suppress your anger. But never getting angry is not a good goal. Anger is normal, and it will come out regardless of how hard you try to tamp it down. The true goal of anger management isn‚Äôt to suppress feelings of anger but rather to understand the message behind the emotion and express it in a healthy way without losing control. When you do, you‚Äôll not only feel better, you‚Äôll also be more likely to get your needs met, be better able to manage conflict in your life, and strengthen your relationships.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe app provides users with education about anger, opportunities for finding support, the ability to create an anger management plan, anger tracking, and tools to help manage angry reactions.\\r\\n\\r\\nDisclaimer: All images are copyright of their perspective owners.

              "   'Description': 'The app has sevenbasic modules: depression, anxiety & panic attacks, self-harm, suicidal thoughts, mood monitoring, eating disorder and professional help resources.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe module DEPRESSION contains the WHAT CAN HELP ME feature, including suggestions that could help the user feel better (e.g. exercise, meditation, listening to music, watching videos, drawing, guided relaxation). ACTIVITY PLANNER, which motivates the user to create a to-do list of tasks (check off, edit or delete the accomplished goals anytime) and WHAT MADE ME HAPPY to help the individual focus on the positives of the past day.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe module ANXIETY & PANIC ATTACKS aims on helping the user overcome intense feelings of anxiety and panic attacks. It includes two types of breathing exercises, designed to immediately help the individual to calm down. The first exercise focuses on deep breathing only ‚Äì switching between inhaling and exhaling. The second exercise is focused on the ‚Äöbox breathing‚Äò technique‚Äì full inhale, holding your breath, full exhale and again holding your breath.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnother feature included in this module is COUNTING of simple mathematical equations to help the user focus on something other than the anxious thoughts and physical reactions that accompany each panic attack. The equations are automatically generated and include addition, subtraction and multiplication of numbers 0 to 9, and are immediately corrected. The last feature in this module includes more suggestions on what to do when feeling anxious (e.g. breathing exercise, count from 100 to 0, watch your favourite film etc.)\\r\\n\\r\\nThe module SELF HARM tries to distract from the urges. Once again it provides two breathing exercises. The feature WHAT CAN HELP ME includes suggestions what to do instead of hurting yourself (take an ice-cube or red marker and move it across your skin where you would usually hurt yourself, write down your emotions and describe how you feel and then destroy the piece of paper, scream, exercise or try to diffuse the intense emotions through painting or guided relaxation).\\r\\n\\r\\nThe SUICIDAL THOUGHTS module provides a list of reasons and activities and which could prevent the thoughts or at least show the value of one‚Äòs life. The users create their own EMERGENCY PLANS. The app enables the user to make list of safe activities as an alternative scenario to follow in crisis. The plan includes: who will I contact, what will I say/write, what will I do or where will I go in case of an emergency. It is ideal to create the plan when one is able to think rationally or with the help of another person. This feature also includes a list of people who care about the individual and would potentially be hurt by his actions.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the REASONS TO STAY ALIVE section, users can create a list of people, things and activities they like or care about enough to stop them from committing suicide. There are a few default entries in the list for users to have an idea what kind of reasons they might put in. And again ‚Äì the breathing exercises are included in the SUICIDAL THOUGHT module.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the last module ‚Äì PROFESSIONAL HELP RESOURCES ‚Äì there is a list of phone numbers with the option of directly calling the ambulance, hot lines and crisis centres. We also included links to chat rooms in case anyone prefers typing over speaking.\\r\\n\\r\\nThank you to Nevypus≈• du≈°i for supporting our app.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe app is open-source with source codes available here: https://github.com/cesko-digital/nepanikar',\n",

              "   'Description': \"How to Talk to a Suicidal Friend\\r\\nIf you have a friend contemplating suicide, you may be scared and unsure how you can reach out to help them. You may be worried you may say the wrong thing or afraid you can‚Äôt handle the responsibility. \\r\\n\\r\\nHow to Help a Suicidal Friend\\r\\nHaving a friend who you believe to be considering suicide is not to be taken lightly. Being suicidal is a temporary state that appears as an answer to severe depression, and the act of taking one's own life is preventable when the correct measures are taken. As a friend, you can potentially save a life by paying attention to warning signs of suicide (in addition to the ones you already know about), making your friend feel supported, and knowing when and how to get outside help. If your friend is in immediate danger call 911, or 1-800-SUICIDE to talk to professionals and access necessary resources.\\r\\n\\r\\nHow to Talk Someone out of Suicide\\r\\nIf someone is considering suicide, your first move should always be to call emergency services, such as dialing 911 or the National Suicide Hotline (1-800-273-TALK) in the US. The two most important things you can do with someone considering suicide are to listen and keep them in your sight at all times. Talking someone out of suicide is a difficult process, and you should always contact professionals to handle this delicate situation.\\r\\n\\r\\nHow to Handle a Suicidal Teenager\\r\\nSuicide is the third leading cause of death for 15-24-year-olds. Girls tend to think about suicide and attempt suicide about twice as often as boys, yet boys die by suicide 4 times more often that girls. Contemplating suicide is a big deal for a teen, and a scary situation for parents. When dealing with a suicidal teen, remain calm and remember that you can handle this.\\r\\n\\r\\nHow to Deal with a Suicidal Person\\r\\n\\r\\nHow to Help Someone Who Is Thinking About Committing Suicide\\r\\nIf you have reason to believe that someone you know is contemplating suicide, you should get help immediately. Whether your friend told you they were thinking of suicide or you just sense a possibility, you should act; doing so can save a life. Call the US National Suicide Prevention Lifeline at 1-800-273-TALK (8255) or 1-800-SUICIDE (1-800-784-2433) or the UK Suicide hotline at 116 123 to learn more about how to provide assistance and find local suicide prevention resources.\\r\\n\\r\\nHow to Empathize with People Who Have Suicidal Tendencies\\r\\nOver 800,000 people die due to suicide every year and there are many more who try to attempt it. Having suicidal tendencies is actually a call for help that shouldn‚Äôt be ignored by the society. \\r\\n\\r\\nHow to Cope when Someone You Care About Is Suicidal\\r\\n\\r\\nHow to Help a Suicidal Family Member\\r\\n\\r\\nHow to Recover from a Friend's Attempted Suicide\\r\\nIt can be very emotional and traumatic to learn that a close friend attempted suicide.\\r\\n\\r\\nHow to Help a Sibling Who Is Contemplating Suicide\\r\\nWhen a family member is contemplating suicide, it doesn't just affect the individual. It will take an emotional toll \\r\\n\\r\\nHow to Recognize the Warning Signs of Suicide\\r\\nSuicide is a leading cause of death in the United States, with 37,500 suicides recorded in 2010.\\r\\n\\r\\nHow to Break Up With Someone Who Is Threatening Suicide\\r\\nHow to Help a Suicidal Autistic Person\\r\\n\\r\\nHow to Deal with Suicidal Parents\\r\\nHaving a suicidal parent is a uniquely difficult experience.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nI will be so gratefull if you download this app and give it 5 star in addition when you share it with your family and friends.\\r\\nDo not hesitate to make your comment, suggestion, advice and so on via rrnshams@gmail.com\\r\\nThank you.\",\n",

The centerpiece of cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) is learning to identify negative and distorted thinking patterns to change your emotions and your behaviors for the better. In CBT, a \"thought record\" guides you through the steps of identifying, challenging, and reinterpreting negative thinking patterns. With Thought Diary, you can document your negative emotions, analyze flaws in your thinking, and re-evaluate your negative thoughts into more balanced ones. It may even help you recognize helpful ways to deal with your negative behaviors and emotions for future situations.\\r\\n\\r\\nCBT Thought Diary can do more than thought records, though! It can also be used as a daily mood tracker. You can even practice gratitude by creating positive entries using our flexible diary entry format. According to positive psychology, appreciating the positives in our lives can improve happiness and meaning.\\r\\n\\xa0\\r\\nWith CBT Thought Diary, you can gradually change your approach to how you interpret the ups and downs of life, making long-lasting changes in your mental well-being.\\r\\n\\r\\nAccording to positive psychology, practicing gratitude and recording positive emotions is important as well. Thought Diary also allows you to keep track of your positive experiences so that you can refer back to them and appreciate the good moments, as well as note down what particular things you\\'re grateful for. This way, you can be more aware and thankful of the positive moments in life.\\r\\n\\r\\nThought Diary will help you evaluate, understand, and change your thoughts and feelings. By using this application, you can work to identify your emotions, analyze how and why you\\'re feeling this way, challenge those negative beliefs, change your thinking patterns for future situations, and remember positive experiences. You can use this app as a mood journal, a thought record journal, and a gratitude journal.\\r\\n\\r\\nThought Records and Gratitude Journals similar to this app are commonly used in paper form in traditional cognitive-behavioral therapy for a variety of mental health disorders such as clinical depression and anxiety. If you are suffering from a mental health disorder, please consult a mental health professional or healthcare provider. \\r\\n\\r\\nPrivacy Policy: https://cbtthoughtdiary.com/privacypolicy\\r\\n\\r\\nTerms Of Service: https://cbtthoughtdiary.com/termsofservice',\n",

Our motivational quotes and testimonials will ensure that you are not alone on this process to shake your drug addiction. \\r\\n \\r\\nTake a look at our top 10 reasons to quit using Drugs:\\r\\n\\r\\n1. Stop the pain!\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen you are addicted to drugs, everything you do becomes more painful when you are not on the drugs. Eventually this will fade, but it can be grueling at first, which is why people become addicts in the first place.\\r\\n\\r\\n2. Change your life\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen you look back on your life, do you want to see the person who was addicted to drugs and not contributing to society? I don't think so.\\r\\n\\r\\n3. Regain your self-esteem\\r\\n\\r\\nDrugs will get you into a cycle of self-loathing and hate. This is a situation that no one wants to be in. When you are addicted to drugs, you start to think that you are worthless and no one likes you.\\r\\n\\r\\n4. Be a good parent\\r\\n\\r\\nIt is not just you suffering from a drug addiction; your children are suffering too. Children need a role model to look up to and if that role model is addicted to drugs, then they are going to see that as normal. Even if they never see you use drugs, children will gravitate towards that state of mind.\\r\\n\\r\\n5. Be a loving spouse\\r\\n\\r\\nDrug use negatively affects relationships, whether its friendships, dating relationships, families, or marriages. Your spouse needs you to be there for them emotionally and physically. When you are using drugs, you are not there emotionally.\\r\\n\\r\\n6. Stop being embarrassed\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen you are addicted to drugs, pretty much everything you do can be embarrassing. Your family and friends will stop inviting you to places simply because you make a fool out of yourself.\\r\\n\\r\\n7. Remember the good times\\r\\n\\r\\nBeing addicted to drugs prevents you from remembering the good experiences in life. You absolutely do not need drugs to have a good time, and when you start remembering things more, you will appreciate the good times even more.\\r\\n\\r\\n8. Be respected by your peers\\r\\n\\r\\nAs a child, you looked up to your parents because they provided for you and gave you unconditional love. At this stage in your life, you need to feel respected in that same way, but the more you use drugs, the less opportunity you are going to have to be respected.\\r\\n\\r\\n9. Provide for your family\\r\\n\\r\\nAccording to Clarity Detox, the average drug addict spends approximately $2,100 - $4,200 per month on various drugs, including heroin and prescription drugs.\\r\\n\\r\\n10. Develop more friendships \\r\\n\\r\\nWhen you are a drug user, you put your friends on the back burner and using drugs take precedent to being a good friend. You used to know what it was like to be a good friend before you started using drugs, right?\\r\\n\\r\\nGet clean!\",\n",

AntiSocial is designed to not only help you understand what ‚Äònormal usage‚Äô looks like, but to give you the tools to manage, block and control your cell phone usage so that you can unplug, minimize distractions and focus on the things that matter.\\r\\nWhile there are other apps available that are designed to restrict phone usage, AntiSocial feels strongly about empowering the user by giving them the information they need to take necessary action. This is done through the clearest and most simple interface available and is the only app to deliver detailed reports full of all the information you need to make an informed decision.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhat makes AntiSocial unique?\\r\\n‚òÖ Your cell phone usage will be benchmarked against all other users.

The app offers the ability to manage, block apps and restrict usage but again, this is entirely up to the user. \\r\\nAntiSocial empowers you to take control of your phone time and minimize distraction.

And while it may not be a catastrophic problem yet, it is becoming harder for us to unplug and disconnect from our phones. We understand it can be difficult to avoid the distraction of our cell phones, especially when it comes to studying, working or downtime.

Chronic meth use will cause permanent brain damage\\r\\n \\r\\nMeth affects the chemical makeup of the brain, and repeated use can lead to permanent damage. The National Institute on Drug Abuse suggests that long-term meth abuse leads to psychological disorders like paranoia, schizophrenia, anxiety and depression. \\r\\n \\r\\n2. Those using meth are likely to end up in the emergency room\\r\\n \\r\\nSince then numbers of emergency room visits have continued to rise. The sooner you quit using the meth you sooner you stop losing control of your actions, which are erratic and might severely injure you or those close to you.\\r\\n \\r\\n3. Meth causes erratic behavior, often leading to legal issues\\r\\n \\r\\nThose who are addicted to meth will exhibit erratic behavior, ranging from violent outbursts to mood swings and an inability to weigh potential consequences. Meth causes people to act in ways they would never act if they were sober. A combination of irrational thinking and erratic behavior lead to legal issues.\\r\\n \\r\\n4. The sooner you quit meth, the sooner you will be able to stop living in constant fear of legal issues\\r\\n \\r\\nThis goes without saying. If you are constantly out doing meth and committing crimes, you are much more likely to have looming legal issues that will eventually catch up to you. \\r\\n \\r\\n5. Your physical appearance will be improve drastically\\r\\n \\r\\nMeth abuse causes major changes to appearance. Meth is an appetite suppressant that leads to extreme weight loss. Those that use meth are inclined to pick at their skin, leaving open wounds, sores and scabs. Eyes become sunken-in and permanent damage to the nasal cavities can occur if meth is being snorted. \\r\\n \\r\\n6. Meth-related overdose is more common than people think\\r\\n \\r\\nThere is a common misconception that you can‚Äôt overdose on meth. This couldn‚Äôt be farther from the truth. Meth is one of the top 10 drugs responsible for the most overdose-related deaths throughout the country. Those who experience acute meth overdose will have a dangerously increased heart rate, fever, and chest pains that could lead to a heart attack or stroke. \\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\nHaving an issue with meth is not uncommon in modern society. Unfortunately meth is very addictive and can cause long term damage.

Being addicted to shopping means that you have less time for social activity\\r\\n \\r\\nShopping is a good escape from reality, but it can become too much of a burden when you are constantly buying random items and mindlessly surfing the internet, looking for other things to buy.\\r\\n \\r\\n2. Shopping addiction can lead to worse things\\r\\n \\r\\nWhen you are addicted to shopping, you will be exposed to many other opportunities to buy things. You might even think that buying drugs could be your next adventure. This is a bad idea. No shopping is the best shopping.\\r\\n \\r\\n3. More time to spend with your family\\r\\n \\r\\nFamily bonding is an important thing in modern culture. With so many distractions including shopping, spending time with family or planning a game night will do wonders for you relationships.\\r\\n \\r\\n4. More time for hobbies\\r\\n \\r\\nShopping addiction takes away from time that you could be spending doing what was once your favorite hobby. Or maybe you can take up a new hobby. Just find a way to get away from shopping\\r\\n \\r\\n5. Are you lying about your shopping addiction?\\r\\n \\r\\nIf you have been lying about your shopping addiction, it is safe to say that you might have a problem. The first step to healing is admitting that you have a problem. This can be hard to do, but help is here.\\r\\n \\r\\n6. Curbing your shopping time\\r\\n \\r\\nA good way to fight shopping addiction is to cut back on your time spent on shopping. There are many good resources online that will force you into certain time blocks on your computer and block access to online stores during the others.\\r\\n \\r\\n7. Mindlessly shopping at work\\r\\n \\r\\nIf you find yourself searching the internet and shopping for random things when you have deadlines to attend to, you might be addicted to shopping. It is important to know when you stray too far. Keep yourself on the right track.\\r\\n \\r\\n8. Restless or moody feelings\\r\\n \\r\\nWhen you are addicted to shopping, nothing can fill that gap of satisfaction that shopping gives you. You might be on a boat and you can‚Äôt stop thinking about checking that next big deal, or when the next 50% off sale is going to be.\\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\n.... Why wait on getting help?

Get the help you deserve by downloading this free app.\\r\\n \\r\\nTake a look at our top 7 reasons to quit marijuana:\\r\\n \\r\\n1. You will have a clear mind\\r\\n \\r\\nFor many lifelong weed smokers, this is the number one reason to quit smoking. If you are finding yourself forgetting simple things and having your mind in a fog for several hours to days after smoking, then quitting marijuana might be the right thing to do. \\r\\n \\r\\n2. Being Ambitious \\r\\n \\r\\nMany people with bright futures have reported that marijuana use destroys their ambition. They come up with interesting ideas when they are high, but don't have the motivation to push through when the time comes. They end up becoming very complacent and don't live up to their full potential.\\r\\n \\r\\n3. Being Energetic\\r\\n \\r\\nAs you age, marijuana starts to take a toll on your body in many ways. Smoking pot to overcome mundane tasks is why you may have started in the first place, but after a while, your lungs will start to clog and your blood flow will slow. \\r\\n \\r\\n4. Having better eating habits\\r\\n \\r\\nEveryone knows that smoking marijuana speeds up your metabolism, which in turn makes you very hungry. This is commonly known as the munchies. No matter what type of foods you are eating, you are still putting a damper on your overall health and digestive tract.\\r\\n \\r\\n5. Having clean lungs\\r\\n \\r\\nThere has been conflicting research about the negative effects of smoking weed, but the unanimous agreement is that you are still inhaling smoke. Chronic use can lead to emphysema, cancer, and other serious health issues.\\r\\n \\r\\n6. Living life by the laws\\r\\n \\r\\nThe longer you smoke weed, the more chances you have of running into trouble with the law. Sure, the growing trend of legalization makes us more brazen about marijuana smoking, but possession is still illegal in most states and STILL a federal crime no matter what. \\r\\n \\r\\n7. Personal safety\\r\\n \\r\\nIs your drug dealer really your friend? He may appear to be, but somewhere along his supply chain, there is some serious illegal activity going on. People who engage in illegal activity are more likely to commit violent crimes which you don't want to be caught in the middle of.\\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\n.... Why wait on getting help?

The centerpiece of cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) is learning to identify negative and distorted thinking patterns to change your emotions and your behaviors for the better. In CBT, a \"thought record\" guides you through the steps of identifying, challenging, and reinterpreting negative thinking patterns. With Thought Diary, you can document your negative emotions, analyze flaws in your thinking, and re-evaluate your negative thoughts into more balanced ones. It may even help you recognize helpful ways to deal with your negative behaviors and emotions for future situations.\\r\\n\\r\\nCBT Thought Diary can do more than thought records, though! It can also be used as a daily mood tracker. You can even practice gratitude by creating positive entries using our flexible diary entry format. According to positive psychology, appreciating the positives in our lives can improve happiness and meaning.\\r\\n\\xa0\\r\\nWith CBT Thought Diary, you can gradually change your approach to how you interpret the ups and downs of life, making long-lasting changes in your mental well-being.\\r\\n\\r\\nAccording to positive psychology, practicing gratitude and recording positive emotions is important as well. Thought Diary also allows you to keep track of your positive experiences so that you can refer back to them and appreciate the good moments, as well as note down what particular things you\\'re grateful for. This way, you can be more aware and thankful of the positive moments in life.\\r\\n\\r\\nThought Diary will help you evaluate, understand, and change your thoughts and feelings. By using this application, you can work to identify your emotions, analyze how and why you\\'re feeling this way, challenge those negative beliefs, change your thinking patterns for future situations, and remember positive experiences. You can use this app as a mood journal, a thought record journal, and a gratitude journal.\\r\\n\\r\\nThought Records and Gratitude Journals similar to this app are commonly used in paper form in traditional cognitive-behavioral therapy for a variety of mental health disorders such as clinical depression and anxiety. If you are suffering from a mental health disorder, please consult a mental health professional or healthcare provider. \\r\\n\\r\\nPrivacy Policy: https://cbtthoughtdiary.com/privacypolicy\\r\\n\\r\\nTerms Of Service: https://cbtthoughtdiary.com/termsofservice',\n",

Sleep Monitor also has a smart alarm clock to remind you to sleep early at night and wake you up gently in the morning. In addition, Sleep Monitor provides relaxing sleep music to help you sleep better.  \\r\\n \\r\\nKey Features:\\r\\n üìä- <b>New Feature: Sleep Trends</b>\\r\\nImprove sleep quality and develop better sleep habits with weekly and monthly data statistics.\\r\\n\\r\\nüéô- <b>Record Snoring or Dream Talking</b>\\r\\nSleep Monitor will record snoring and grinding sounds made during your sleep, listen to them, and find more about your sleep the next morning!

Usually, sleepers will pass four sleep stages in one sleep cycle: Non-REM 1(between waking and sleep), Non-REM 2(light sleep), Non-REM 3(deep sleep), and REM (Rapid Eye Movement, when most dreaming happens) sleep. These stages progress cyclically from 1 through REM then begin again with stage 1. A complete sleep cycle takes an average of 90 to 110 minutes, with each stage lasting between 5 to 25 minutes.\\r\\n \\r\\nSleep Monitor uses both microphone and accelerator sensors to measure body movements and environmental noise changes and then recognize your sleep stages.\\r\\n \\r\\nüìà- <b>Get Your Sleep Score</b>\\r\\nSleep Monitor will generate useful information for you after tracking, like sleep score, sleep cycle graphic, sleep statistics, sleep noise audios. Get your daily, weekly, or monthly sleep insights and use those data to help you sleep better. Sleep Monitor is especially helpful for those who want a way to check how their sleep is, and do not want to invest in an accessory like a smart band or smartwatch.\\r\\n \\r\\n‚è∞ - <b>Set Smart Alarm Clock</b>\\r\\nSet an alarm for your morning wake-up or nap or set a reminder for bedtime.\\r\\n \\r\\nüéµ- <b>Listen to Soothing Lullabies</b>\\r\\nSuffering from insomnia?

Lo√≥na isn‚Äôt a list of direct go-to-sleep techniques, but rather a mood-altering app that helps you to stay calm during the day and prepares you emotionally to fall asleep easily in the evening.\\r\\n \\r\\n- WHY IS BEDTIME MOOD IMPORTANT?\\r\\nNegative emotions we accumulate during the day are processed and consolidated by our brain during sleep making them more difficult to disassociate from when faced again in the future. Moreover, feeling angry, anxious, down, or, the opposite, excited, and elated, is likely to affect latencies to sleep onset and REM-sleep. People mistake it for the symptoms of a sleep disorder, but in reality, they just may be in the wrong mood to sleep well.\\r\\n \\r\\n- HOW DOES LO√ìNA WORK?\\r\\nFrom the wake up and during the busy day Lo√≥na will support your emotional states with playlists and immersive stories. Each night you‚Äôll have a recommended sleepscape. A sleepscape is a guided session that bundles together  CBT, activity-based relaxation, storytelling and sleep sounds in a unique way. Complete it to shut the frantic world out,relieve anxiety, reset your mind, and create the perfect mood for sleep.  Focus on calming activities and quiet your racing thoughts.\\r\\n\\r\\n- IS IT DIFFERENT FROM SLEEP MEDITATION?\\r\\n\\r\\nMastering sleep meditation techniques require a lot of patience and time. Starting your Lo√≥na journey is as easy as playing a relaxing game for just 15 minutes a day.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhat do you get:\\r\\n- 70+ interactive sleepscape journeys\\r\\n- immersive bedtime stories\\r\\n- music to relax, calm down or focus\\r\\n- nature sounds including rain sounds and ocean waves, wind or white noise for tinnitus relief\\r\\n- lullabies to help you put your kids to bed\\r\\n- breathing exercises\\r\\n- gentle alarm clock\\r\\n- affirmations and motivational quotes\\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\nTerms of service: http://loona.app/terms\\r\\nPrivacy policy: http://loona.app/privacy\",\n",

Unlike sleeping pills, it helps to eliminate the underlying causes of sleeping problems and develop better sleep habits‚ú®. \\r\\n\\r\\n‚≠êÔ∏è <b>HOW AVRORA WORKS</b>\\r\\n\\r\\n‚≠êÔ∏è <b>Falling asleep:</b>\\r\\nDeep calm breathing leads to the predominance of the processes of inhibition in the central nervous system. It allows to regulate pressure and heartbeat, focus attention on breathing, thereby distracting from unwanted thoughts. Deep and controlled breathing is evolutionarily associated with a feeling of rest and relaxation. In addition, soothing sounds provide an opportunity to relax and get a positive emotion, effectively reducing the likelihood of excitation before sleep. \\r\\n\\r\\n‚≠êÔ∏è <b>Sleep retention:</b>\\r\\nBreathing technique results in more reliable replacement of wakefulness rhythms (alpha and beta waves) with low-amplitude sleep waves (theta and delta waves), thus making sleep much more durable. Meditation sessions promote deep relaxation, bring the body to a deep and lasting sleep. Bedtime meditation qualitatively improves the most fragile REM phase, which allows you to complete a full sleep cycle and feel yourself full of energy in the morning.\\r\\n\\r\\n‚≠êÔ∏è <b>Awakening:</b>\\r\\nAfter a good deep sleep your body is restored and is ready to function in full. <b>Smart alarm</b> analyzes your sleeping schedule and wakes you up gently from the lightest phase in your sleep cycle. Pleasant alarm melodies allow you to wake up gently, gradually and with no stress. It is very important to live the first minutes of your day with positive emotions and thoughts.  \\r\\n\\r\\n‚≠êÔ∏è <b>WHY DO YOU NEED AVRORA?</b>\\r\\n\\r\\nAsk yourself the following questions: \\r\\n‚ùì Do you face difficulty getting to sleep or staying asleep?\\r\\n‚ùì Do you feel tired in the morning right after you wake up? \\r\\n‚ùì Do you have difficulty concentrating during the day?\\r\\n‚ùì Are you struggling to stay organized? \\r\\n‚ùì Do you feel so tired that all you can think about is sleep?\\r\\nIf you answered yes to any of these questions, then you can definitely benefit from using <b>Avrora</b> app for sleep and well-being improvement.

The centerpiece of cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) is learning to identify negative and distorted thinking patterns to change your emotions and your behaviors for the better.

With Thought Diary, you can document your negative emotions, analyze flaws in your thinking, and re-evaluate your negative thoughts into more balanced ones. It may even help you recognize helpful ways to deal with your negative behaviors and emotions for future situations.\\r\\n\\r\\nCBT Thought Diary can do more than thought records, though! It can also be used as a daily mood tracker. You can even practice gratitude by creating positive entries using our flexible diary entry format. According to positive psychology, appreciating the positives in our lives can improve happiness and meaning.\\r\\n\\xa0\\r\\nWith CBT Thought Diary, you can gradually change your approach to how you interpret the ups and downs of life, making long-lasting changes in your mental well-being.\\r\\n\\r\\nAccording to positive psychology, practicing gratitude and recording positive emotions is important as well. Thought Diary also allows you to keep track of your positive experiences so that you can refer back to them and appreciate the good moments, as well as note down what particular things you\\'re grateful for. This way, you can be more aware and thankful of the positive moments in life.\\r\\n\\r\\nThought Diary will help you evaluate, understand, and change your thoughts and feelings. By using this application, you can work to identify your emotions, analyze how and why you\\'re feeling this way, challenge those negative beliefs, change your thinking patterns for future situations, and remember positive experiences. You can use this app as a mood journal, a thought record journal, and a gratitude journal.\\r\\n\\r\\nThought Records and Gratitude Journals similar to this app are commonly used in paper form in traditional cognitive-behavioral therapy for a variety of mental health disorders such as clinical depression and anxiety. If you are suffering from a mental health disorder, please consult a mental health professional or healthcare provider. \\r\\n\\r\\nPrivacy Policy: https://cbtthoughtdiary.com/privacypolicy\\r\\n\\r\\nTerms Of Service: https://cbtthoughtdiary.com/termsofservice',\n",

They often create multiple medical problems and can even be acutely life-threatening, requiring hospitalization and forced nourishment.

Symptoms include trying to maintain a below-normal weight through starvation or too much exercise. Medical treatment may be needed to restore normal weight. Download this free app to help you overcome. \\r\\n \\r\\nHere are our top 8 reasons to say no to anorexia:\\r\\n \\r\\n1. Stop feeling isolated from others\\r\\n \\r\\nIt is not easy to explain to others why you aren‚Äôt eating. Anorexia keeps you in a bubble, and that cannot be a good thing. Social experience is a part of being human, and when you start isolating yourself for being anorexic, you experience emotional and physical pain.\\r\\n \\r\\n2. Malnutrition is a big issue\\r\\n \\r\\nMalnutrition happens when your body is deprived of essential calories and nutrients that you need to survive. The constant food restriction of anorexia makes your body malnourished and more prone to illnesses and disease.\\r\\n \\r\\n3. Anorexic dehydration\\r\\n \\r\\nMild dehydration will cause dry skin, head rushes, chills, and weakness. More serious dehydration will lead to increased heart rate and heavier breathing. If you let it go any farther than this, you will be at risk for cardiac arrest, seizures, and even unconsciousness.\\r\\n \\r\\n4. Anorexia makes you lose hair\\r\\n \\r\\nThe lack of nutrients entering your body forces your body to condense its functional responses. Anything that your body feels unnecessary for survival will start to get less nutrients. This starts with your hair. Your hair may thin or start falling out. \\r\\n \\r\\n5. Random thin hairs will start growing on your body\\r\\n \\r\\nYour body must compensate for the lack of insulation that your body provides, so in a last ditch attempt to save your internal temperature; you will start growing thin hairs on your face and in other unwanted areas of the body.\\r\\n \\r\\n6. Anorexia makes your fingernails brittle\\r\\n \\r\\nThis goes back to the lack of nutrition flowing through your body.

Anorexia is an eating disorder that is characterized by extreme weight loss. People suffering from anorexia struggle to maintain a weight that is appropriate to age and height and could have a distorted body image.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnorexia affects the body‚Äôs overall health in a dramatic and dangerous way. [1] According to the National Eating Disorder‚Äôs Association, you cannot tell that a person is suffering from anorexia just by looking at them. [2] Studies have shown that this eating disorder can occur in individuals across body types, age, gender, and ethnicity.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt is important to seek professional help to treat an eating disorder. Psychosocial support and participation in counseling are essential facets of treatment for anorexia nervosa. Effective home remedies can help in being a complementary and supportive technique for people with anorexia.\\r\\n\\r\\nAre you experiencing unexplained weight loss? Are you afraid to gain weight and therefore you avoid meals? You might be suffering from Anorexia Nervosa. Anorexia Nervosa (or simply known as anorexia) is an eating disorder causing a severe weight loss. More than physical, it is a mental condition. The main symptoms of anorexia are fatigue, insomnia, low body weight, pale skin, hair loss, brittle nails, depression, dry skin, constipation, low blood pressure, chronic fatigue, frequent mood swings, avoiding social gatherings, etc. The biggest problem with the treatment of anorexia is that it is really difficult to diagnose and should not be confused with bulimia, a similar but distinct condition. And, it can cause serious physical disorders such as bone weight loss, anemia, imbalance of electrolytes in the body, kidney problems, etc., if it is not cured timely. It would be wise to consult a doctor and psychologists to treat this condition. However, some of the natural remedies can also be helpful to cure anorexia.',\n",

With body image in our culture being on the forefront of our minds, it is no surprise that not people realize that this is a problem and can be highly addicting. Bulimia Nervosa Help Calendar can help you put an end to your bulimia addiction by holding you accountable, offering solutions, words of encouragement, and science based facts that will help you get past your bulimia nervosa.\\r\\n \\r\\nFeatures:\\r\\n1. Use our counter to track your progress down to the second.\\r\\n2. Create your own reasons to quit bulimia, or use one of our scientifically based facts about quitting.\\r\\n3. Change the look and feel of the app with our skins section to personalize the app to what you want.\\r\\n4. Add reasons why you would like to see yourself succeed and stop bulimia.\\r\\n5. Our special panic button will help you send a text to a friend that may be able to help you and be an accountability partner.\\r\\n6. Our badge system allows you to be rewarded for your success.\\r\\n7. Our distractions section will help you take your mind off of bulimia and introduce you to something more positive and soothing.\\r\\n8. Our motivational quotes and testimonials will ensure that you are not alone in this process to shake bulimia.\\r\\n \\r\\nBulimia is a potentially life-threatening eating disorder. People with this condition binge eat. They then take steps to avoid weight gain. Most commonly, this means vomiting (purging). But it can also mean excessive exercising or fasting. Treatments include counseling, medications, and nutrition education.\\r\\n \\r\\nHere are our top 8 reasons to say no to bulimia:\\r\\n \\r\\n1. Stop feeling isolated from others\\r\\n \\r\\nIt is not easy to explain to others why you have to go to the bathroom and throw up after a meal. Bulimia keeps you in a bubble, and that cannot be a good thing. Social experience is a part of being human, and when you start isolating yourself for being Bulimic, you experience emotional and physical pain.\\r\\n \\r\\n2. Malnutrition is a big issue\\r\\n \\r\\nMalnutrition happens when your body is deprived of essential calories and nutrients that you need to survive. The constant food restriction of Bulimia makes your body malnourished and more prone to illnesses and disease.\\r\\n \\r\\n3. Bulimic dehydration\\r\\n \\r\\nMild dehydration will cause dry skin, head rushes, chills, and weakness. More serious dehydration will lead to increased heart rate and heavier breathing. If you let it go any farther than this, you will be at risk for cardiac arrest, seizures, and even unconsciousness.\\r\\n \\r\\n4. Bulimia makes you lose hair\\r\\n \\r\\nThe lack of nutrients entering your body forces your body to condense its functional responses. Anything that your body feels unnecessary for survival will start to get less nutrients. This starts with your hair. Your hair may thin or start falling out.\\r\\n \\r\\n5. Random thin hairs will start growing on your body\\r\\n \\r\\nYour body must compensate for the lack of insulation that your body provides, so in a last ditch attempt to save your internal temperature; you will start growing thin hairs on your face and in other unwanted areas of the body.\\r\\n \\r\\n6. Bulimia makes your fingernails brittle\\r\\n \\r\\nThis goes back to the lack of nutrition flowing through your body. Your fingernails are not an essential part of your body when you are not getting enough nutrients, so your body will shut down the flow of nutrients to your nails.\\r\\n \\r\\n7. You could become infertile!\\r\\n \\r\\nBody fat is essential for menstruation. Not only will you lose your ability to become pregnant, but you will also stop having your period. Some may see this as a perk, but extended periods of this will lead to permanent infertility.\\r\\n \\r\\n8. Bone loss\\r\\n \\r\\nWith Bulimia, bones become more brittle because of the lack of nutrient delivery. This will lead to having weaker bones and increase the chances of your bones breaking.\\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\nIf you are having trouble with bulimia or being bulimic, simply download Bulimia Nervosa Help Calendar for FREE and get help now!',\n",

Clinical depression is a mood disorder in which feelings of sadness, loss, anger, or frustration interfere with everyday life for weeks or longer. Clinical depression generally responds positively to treatment, so it is important to seek treatment if you are concerned about your mental health. \\r\\n\\r\\nNew Feature: Keep your results private with a passcode lock! \\r\\n\\r\\nDISCLAIMER: This self-test is not meant to be a diagnosis for your depression. Remember that this app should not be used as a replacement for professional treatment or guidance.\\r\\n\\r\\n[1] Kroenke, K., Spitzer, R. L., & Williams, J. B. W. (2001).

By applying this process, you will be able to recognize specific diseases and prescribe the most effective therapy.\\r\\n\\r\\nEach chapter addresses one common complaint and begins with a case and guidance on how to organize the differential diagnosis. As the case progresses, clinical reasoning is explained in detail. The differential diagnosis for that particular case is summarized in tables that highlight the clinical clues and important testsfor the leading diagnostic hypothesis and alternative diagnostic hypotheses. As the chapter progresses, the pertinent diseases are reviewed. Just as in real life, the case unfolds in a stepwise fashion as tests are performed and diagnoses are confirmed or refuted.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe third edition is enhanced by the addition of five new chapters--Bleeding Disorders, Dysuria, Hematuria, Hypotension, and Sore Throat--as well as a greater emphasis on how to master the process of working from patient level data (signs, symptoms, and laboratory tests). All chapters incorporate the latest research resulting in new and refined approaches to common symptoms encountered in clinical medicine.',\n",

About three billion people are at risk of infection in 109 countries. Each year, there are an estimated 250 million cases of malaria leading to approximately one million deaths, mostly in children under five years of age. The organism that causes the most dangerous form of malaria is a microscopic parasite called Plasmodium falciparum.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis parasite is transmitted by mosquito species belonging to the Anopheles genus and only by females of those species.\\r\\nThere is growing international agreement on how best to use prevention and treatment methods that are available. The most effective prevention measures include the use of mosquito bed nets treated with long-lasting insecticides to avoid the mosquito bites and to kill the mosquitoes and spraying the inside walls of houses with similar insecticides to kill malaria-carrying mosquitoes. The most effective treatment for malaria consists in using a combination of several anti-malarial drugs, one of which is a derivative of artemisinin. Preventive treatment of pregnant women with anti-malarial drugs can also reduce the harmful effects of malaria both on the mother and on the unborn child.',\n",

Omdat malaria minder vaak voorkomt, is ook het risico voor reizigers sinds 2000 gedaald. Vooral reizigers naar gebieden met een laag risico, waar uw bestemming toe behoort, lopen reizigers steeds minder risico op malaria. Daarom wordt voor deze gebieden sinds 1 april 2017 niet langer geadviseerd elke dag preventief antimalariamiddelen te slikken. Sindsdien wordt geadviseerd om een noodbehandeling mee te nemen. Deze behandeling hoeft alleen ingenomen te worden als u klachten krijgt die mogelijk door malaria kunnen worden veroorzaakt. Voor de instructies over het meenemen van de noodbehandeling raden wij u aan de folder ‚ÄòMalaria-noodbehandeling‚Äô zorgvuldig te lezen. Het doel van dit onderzoek is het effect van deze gewijzigde adviezen te beoordelen.',\n",

Infected mosquitoes carry the Plasmodium parasite. When this mosquito bites you, the parasite is released into your bloodstream. Once the parasites are inside your body, they travel to the liver, where they mature. After several days, the mature parasites enter the bloodstream and begin to infect red blood cells.\\r\\n\\r\\nMalaria can occur if a mosquito infected with the Plasmodium parasite bites you. There are four kinds of malaria parasites that can infect humans: Plasmodium vivax, P. ovale, P. malariae, and P. falciparum.\\r\\n\\r\\nApp Features:\\r\\n1. Detailed Information\\r\\n5.

The app counts infected and uninfected red blood cells in blood smear images captured by the smartphone camera when attached to the eyepiece of a microscope. It uses image analysis and machine learning methods to identify individual cells and discriminates between infected and uninfected cells. The app reports the detected parasitemia to the user and stores it in a patient database, allowing monitoring of patients over time.\\r\\n\\r\\nNLM Malaria Screener is an R&D project of the Lister Hill National Center of Biomedical Communications, which is a division of the National Library of Medicine (NLM) at the National Institutes of Health (NIH). The app development is in tight collaboration with national and international partners, including Mahidol University (Thailand), University of Oxford (UK), and University of Missouri.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe app is currently in a beta testing phase and ongoing research and development aims at adding more functionality in the future. Organizations and institutes with a vested interest in malaria diagnosis, either for research or field screening, are welcomed to test the beta version and to provide feedback, which would help in the improvement of the app. If interested, please contact us at the email address given in the app, or visit our project webpage https://ceb.nlm.nih.gov/projects/malaria-screener/',\n",

We might add soon info about malaria in other countries, such as Kenya. We have also included basic info about how you can prevent getting malaria, either if you live in Tanzania or you are just travelling. \\r\\n\\r\\nMalaria is caused by mosquitoes bites. In fact, mosquitoes are the most mortiferous animals. They not only cause malaria, but other diseases as well: Zika virus, dengue, yellow fever...\\r\\n\\r\\nThe images you play with are photographies of real blood samples from patients from Mozambique and South Africa. While playing you will hunt for \"Plasmodiums\", the parasites responsible for malaria. The best you do it, the higher your score will be and the furthest you will advance in the game. Your goal?

Brain cells begin to die in minutes.\\r\\nA stroke is a medical emergency, and prompt treatment is crucial. Early action can reduce brain damage and other complications. The good news is that many fewer Americans die of stroke now than in the past. Effective treatments can also help prevent disability from stroke.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe loss of blood flow to the brain damages tissues within the brain. Symptoms of a stroke show up in the body parts controlled by the damaged areas of the brain. The sooner a person having a stroke gets care, the better their outcome is likely to be.

It includes the six regions of the Americas (Andean, Caribbean, Central, North, South, and Tropical) according to tables published in 2019 by the World Health Organization (WHO) (Lancet, 2019). This risk score was based on extensive review of available cohorts and were adapted to 21 global regions based on analysis of the burden of cardiovascular morbidity. For each region, an estimate was published that requires knowing an individual's blood cholesterol level (or other information if the blood cholesterol level is not known). The Pan American Health Organization (PAHO), with the financial contribution of the U.S Centers for Diseases Prevention and Control, transformed the published color-coded tables into an online electronic calculator for use on computers and smartphones, updating the previous Cardiocal app (2014)\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nWho is this app for?\\r\\n\\r\\nThe calculator is intended to help the health care providers quickly calculate cardiovascular risk and discuss with patients the extent to which their risk can be reduced. It also aims to help people concerned about their health, making it easier for them to estimate the need for a medical consultation when their risk is not low. The treatment recommendations are oriented to the assisting professionals and do not constitute a guide to self-medication, which can be dangerous. Under no circumstances is this calculator intended as a replacement for medical consultation or a clinical judgment.\\r\\n\\r\\nFeatures\\r\\n\\r\\n¬ª Click on the gear icon to choose a country.

The warning sign of heart problem and knowing the risk of heart disease is the first step of avoiding from heart attack or stroke. The information of the Heart disease is Heart disease describes a range of conditions that affect the heart. Diseases under heart disease include blood vessel diseases, such as coronary artery disease is heart rhythm problems (arrhythmias); and heart defects you\\'re born with (congenital heart defects), among others.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe term \"heart disease\" is often used interchangeably with the term \"cardiovascular disease.\" Cardiovascular disease generally refers to conditions that involve narrowed or blocked blood vessels that can lead to a heart attack, chest pain (angina) or stroke. Other heart conditions, such as those that affect your heart\\'s muscle, valves or rhythm, also are considered forms of heart disease.\\r\\n\\r\\nCardiovascular disease symptoms may be different for men and women. For instance, men are more likely to have chest pain; women are more likely to have other symptoms along with chest discomfort, such as shortness of breath, nausea and extreme fatigue. \\r\\nSymptoms can include:\\r\\n\\r\\n1.\\tChest pain, chest tightness, chest pressure and chest discomfort (angina)\\r\\n2.\\tShortness of breath\\r\\n3.\\tPain, numbness, weakness or coldness in your legs or arms if the blood vessels in \\r\\n        those parts of your body are narrowed\\r\\n4.\\tPain in the neck, jaw, throat, upper abdomen or back\\r\\n5.\\tChest pain, chest tightness, chest pressure and chest discomfort (angina)\\r\\n6.\\tShortness of breath\\r\\n7.\\tPain, numbness, weakness or coldness in your legs or arms if the blood vessels in \\r\\n        those parts of your body are narrowed\\r\\n8.\\tPain in the neck, jaw, throat, upper abdomen or back\\r\\n        Risk factors\\r\\n‚Ä¢\\tAge. Aging increases your risk of damaged and narrowed arteries and weakened or \\r\\n        thickened heart muscle.\\r\\n‚Ä¢\\tSex. Men are generally at greater risk of heart disease. However, women\\'s risk \\r\\n        increases after menopause.\\r\\n‚Ä¢\\tFamily history. A family history of heart disease increases your risk of coronary artery \\r\\n        disease, especially if a parent developed it at an early age \\r\\n‚Ä¢\\tSmoking. Nicotine constricts your blood vessels, and carbon monoxide can damage \\r\\n        their inner lining, making them more susceptible to atherosclerosis. Heart attacks are \\r\\n        more common in smokers than in nonsmokers.\\r\\n‚Ä¢\\tHigh blood pressure. Uncontrolled high blood pressure can result in hardening and \\r\\n        thickening of your arteries, narrowing the vessels through which blood flows.\\r\\n‚Ä¢\\tHigh blood cholesterol levels. High levels of cholesterol in your blood can increase the \\r\\n        risk of formation of plaques and atherosclerosis.\\r\\n‚Ä¢\\tDiabetes. Diabetes increases your risk of heart disease. Both conditions share similar \\r\\n        risk factors, such as obesity and high blood pressure.\\r\\n‚Ä¢\\tObesity. Excess weight typically worsens other risk factors which diet that\\'s high in \\r\\n        fat, salt, sugar and cholesterol can contribute to the development of heart disease.\\r\\n‚Ä¢\\tPhysical inactivity. Lack of exercise also is associated with many forms of heart \\r\\n        disease and some of its other risk factors, as well.\\r\\n‚Ä¢\\tStress. Unrelieved stress may damage your arteries and worsen other risk factors for \\r\\n        heart disease.\\r\\n\\r\\nComplications\\r\\n\\r\\n‚Ä¢\\tHeart failure. \\r\\n‚Ä¢\\tHeart attack.\\r\\n‚Ä¢\\tStroke. \\r\\n‚Ä¢\\tAneurysm. \\r\\n‚Ä¢\\tPeripheral artery disease.\\r\\n‚Ä¢\\tSudden cardiac arrest.',\n",

A cardiac cycle is a full process from the beginning of one heartbeat to the beginning of the next. The length of time between successful heartbeats can vary by up to 20%, but if the differences are longer or erratic, you may need to investigate this further.\\r\\n‚Ä¢ Heart rate. You can use the HeartScan app as a resting heart rate monitor, and get a very accurate measure of the heart rate. This is much more meticulous than pulsometer apps that rely on the phone\\'s camera and finger for a pulse ‚Äì HeartScan goes right to the \"heart\" of the matter.\\r\\n‚Ä¢ Length of each recorded cardiac cycle, which makes it possible to use the app as an hrv monitor.\\r\\n‚Ä¢ Distribution of the lengths of all recorded cardiac cycles.\\r\\n‚Ä¢ Combined cardiac cycle.\\r\\n‚Ä¢ Clear signs of abnormalities that may need attention and further detection by a healthcare professional.\\r\\n\\r\\nYou can save your measurements and view them later using the history section of the app so you can track and monitor your progress over time.\\r\\n\\r\\nIMPORTANT:\\r\\nTHIS APPLICATION IS INTENDED TO BE USED BY ADULTS\\r\\nTHIS APPLICATION SHOULD NOT BE USED BY A PERSON WITH A PACEMAKER\\r\\nTHIS APPLICATION IS NOT A MEDICAL DEVICE AND IS NOT FOR MEDICAL PURPOSES\\r\\nPLEASE REMEMBER THAT THE HEARTSCAN APP IS NOT A REPLACEMENT FOR THE PROFESSIONAL EXPERTISE OF A HEALTHCARE PROFESSIONAL.

              "   'Description': 'The Heart App¬© on a mission to reduce fatalities due to heart diseases.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Heart App¬© aims to help people find out if they are at risk of, or are developing a heart attack based on some questions regarding their seemingly serious or not so serious chest complaints. These questions try to mimic the sequential procedure that heart-specialists follow while diagnosing a patient. The Heart App¬© can also be of use to paramedical staff operating in field.\\r\\n\\r\\nA majority of patients get some warning symptoms before a full-blown heart attack occurs, and if they are provided appropriate treatment in time, heart attack can even be avoided! It is these avoidable fatalities that we hope to stop with the help of the heart app¬©. A critical step in this direction is the information about heart attacks and coronary artery disease packed in the app in practical and easy to read compartments. The Heart App¬© would not only improves people‚Äôs awareness but also provide them a ready reference in their time of need.\\r\\n\\r\\nAmple amount of research categorically points out that mortality and morbidity due to heart attack can be substantially prevented by two key methods- awareness and timely-treatment. Of the two key factors, timely treatment is a more concrete factor and if we could somehow equip people with accurate information via a pervasive medium then millions of lives can be saved. Probably The Heart App¬© can be of help here\\r\\n\\r\\nAt the time of heart attack every second is important since the damage to heart is time dependent. Maximum deaths occur due to abnormal heart beats.  These abnormal heart beats are due to electrical instability in the heart muscles which are dying due to heart attack.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Heart App when utilized by nonmedical personnel helps bring medical attention to people at risk.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn this new version we have added the following:\\r\\n\\r\\nINR Clinic-  \\r\\nWarfarin and Acitrom are used to prolong the normal clotting time in human body and are known as anticoagulant. They are required to preventformation of unwanted blood clot or prevent progression of already formed blood clot.\\r\\n\\r\\nDiseases where you need this drug\\r\\n\\r\\n‚Ä¢   Metallic Prosthetic Heart Valves\\r\\n\\r\\n‚Ä¢   Atrial fibrillation\\r\\n\\r\\n‚Ä¢   Deep vein thrombosis\\r\\n\\r\\n‚Ä¢   Pulmonary Embolism\\r\\n\\r\\nHere user will know about the calculation of doses of warfarin or acitrom as per their PT-INR report. By using this app their record of INR will be maintained automatically and this will be of great help when they will visit their doctor for consultation. This digital way can help patients who are unable to connect with doctors frequently.\\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\nMy records- \\r\\nIn this section a person can maintain the record of his blood pressure and diabetes along with medication. Hypertension or high blood pressure and Diabetes are the most important risk factors for heart diseases and stroke. This record will help the physician in the management of these patients.\\r\\n\\r\\nHere one can store his/her treatment related documents which will be very handy when they visit their doctors.\\r\\n\\r\\nDiet & Exercise \\r\\nThis section will provide relevant information regarding diet and exercise to live a healthy life\\r\\n\\r\\nHealth updates- \\r\\nIn this part user will get relevant, useful, evidence based information regarding medical filed.\\r\\n \\r\\nThe Heart App is meant solely for the welfare of common man but we cannot do it without your help. We request you to share The Heart App¬© with your family & friends, and contribute to our small effort of fighting heart diseases which claim millions of innocent lives.\\r\\n\\r\\nPlease note that The Heart App¬©, by no means, intends to replace the clinical judgment of a doctor; rather its main purpose is to educate people, prevent them from ignoring an emergency and enable seeking early treatment.\\r\\n\\r\\nDr.Rajeev Rathi Cardiologist                          drrajeevrathi.com',\n",

The most common symptom is a heart attack. If coronary heart disease is not treated, some of the plaques in the coronary arteries can break away and block the blood flow to the heart. Coronary heart disease is the most common cause of sudden death. It is also the most common cause of death in people over 65 years old. Men are 10 times more likely to get coronary heart disease than women.\\r\\n\\r\\nExtensive clinical and statistical studies have identified several factors that increase the risk of coronary heart disease and heart attack\\r\\n\\r\\n Major risk factors are those that research has shown significantly increase the risk of heart and blood vessel (cardiovascular) disease.\\r\\n\\r\\nAbout 82 percent of people who die of coronary heart disease are 65 or older. At older ages, women who have heart attacks are more likely than men are to die from them within a few weeks.\\r\\n\\r\\nMen have a greater risk of heart attack than women do, and they have attacks earlier in life. Even after menopause, when women's death rate from heart disease increases,it's not as great as men's.\\r\\n\\r\\nTherefore it is necessary to calculate the overall risk of the heart disease before its to late.\\r\\n\\r\\nFor more Information, feedback and suggestions  email us to contact@compurxinfotech.com\",\n",

Yoga is a mind-body-soul treatment that‚Äôs frequently suggested to heal not only back pain but the stress that come with it. Yoga‚Äôs focus on balance and steadiness encourages your body to develop defenses against the causes of back pain, which include weak abdominal and pelvic muscles, as well lack of flexibility in the hips.\\r\\nAccording to research yoga may even help reduce the need for pain medication.\\r\\n\\r\\n<b>2. Vedic Exercise / workout</b>\\r\\nVedic exercise and workout activities can keep the back healthy by letting discs to exchange fluids which makes it easy receives its nutrition. A healthy disc gets swell up with water and squeeze it out, just like sponge. This sponge action delivers nutrients to the disc.\\r\\nExercise can ease stiffness of back muscles and flex the connective fiber of ligaments & tendons. Thus, improves mobility by reducing tension of muscle.\\r\\nAnother vital effect of exercise is that it stretches and repairs muscles. It increases blood circulation to muscle thus boost optimum oxygen supply.\\r\\nAnother advantage of back exercise is that the motion helps lubricate the facet joints, which are synovial joints that need proper motion.\\r\\n\\r\\n<b>3. Pranayama</b>\\r\\nThe breath is an essential part of yoga practice and pranayama is the formal practice of regulating the breath. PRANA means life force, energy or Qi, & AYAMA is the sanskrit word for ‚Äòextension‚Äô. In Chinese Medicine the concept of prana (or Qi) is defined as energy on the verge of materializing.\\r\\nBy breathing more deeply within the pranayama practice, we are boosting more oxygen to the tissues and breaking this cycle. We can also use our breath as a way to calm our nervous system. Extending the exhalation so that it is longer than the inhalation reduces the resting level of the sympathetic nervous system so that the parasympathetic nervous system can conserve energy and we can feel more relaxed.\\r\\n\\r\\n<b>Features:</b>\\r\\n- 3D model animation yoga & exercise training\\r\\n- Easy to understand home-based yoga, workouts & exercise\\r\\n- Personal trainer to keep track of daily back pain relief plan\\r\\n- Addition in-detail videos to understand Yoga poses, Pranayama & Exercises better way\\r\\n- Pain relief blogs for additional daily tips on Back pain therapy\\r\\n- More customize plans for each user\\r\\n- Nonveg / Veg / Vegan diet for all kind of users.\\r\\n- Daily workout and diet tracker\\r\\n- Daily reminder to keep you on track\\r\\n\\r\\n<b><u>Easy, helpful and FREE!</u></b> What are you waiting for?\\r\\nWishing you Happy Backpain Free Journey with us‚Ä¶ Enjoy‚Ä¶\\r\\nFind out even more at http://www.drzio.com.\\r\\n\\r\\n<b>Disclaimer</b>\\r\\nPlease make note that this product is not at all replacement of any medicine\\xa0or any of present therapy.

              "   'Description': \"<b>How to Relieve Back Pain</b>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nPerhaps you bent the wrong way while lifting something heavy. Or you're dealing with a degenerative condition like arthritis. Whatever the cause, once you have low back pain, it can be hard to shake. About one in four Americans say they've had a recent bout of low back pain. And almost everyone can expect to experience back pain at some point in their lives.\\r\\n\\r\\nSometimes, it‚Äôs clearly serious: You were injured, or you feel numbness, weakness, or tingling in the legs. Call the doctor, of course. But for routine and mild low back pain, here are a few simple tips to try at home.\\r\\n\\r\\n<b>Chill it.</b> Ice is best in the first 24 to 48 hours after an injury because it reduces inflammation.\\r\\n\\r\\n<b>Keep moving.</b> Our spines are like the rest of our body -- they're meant to move. Keep doing your daily activities. Make the beds, go to work, walk the dog. Once you're feeling better, regular aerobic exercises like swimming, bicycling, and walking can keep you -- and your back -- more mobile. Just don't overdo it. There's no need to run a marathon when your back is sore.\\r\\n\\r\\n<b>Stay strong.</b> Once your low back pain has receded, you can help avert future episodes of back pain by working the muscles that support your lower back, including the back extensor muscles. Having strong hip, pelvic, and abdominal muscles also gives you more back support. Avoid abdominal crunches, because they can actually put more strain on your back.\\r\\n\\r\\n<b>Ways to Manage Low Back Pain at Home</b>\\r\\n\\r\\n<b>Sleep Better:</b> When you have back pain, sleeping can be hard.

It‚Äôs actually a good tip: That way, you can remember your triggers and identify trends over time, which can help you figure out which medications and treatments are working, and even potentially learn more about what‚Äôs causing your back pain. Another huge advantage: pain tracking helps you give a more detailed picture of your health to your doctor.\\r\\n\\r\\n<b>Keeping a journal can help you manage your chronic pain and pinpoint your most successful treatment options. </b>\\r\\nBack pain is one of the most common physical ailments. Studies show that eight in 10 Americans have back pain at some point in their lives, usually in the lower back.\\r\\n\\r\\nYour might have sprained it while working in the yard or cleaning house. Or your back might hurt from an old sports injury or a chronic condition such as arthritis or ankylosing spondylitis.\\r\\nSudden or severe back pain should be checked by a doctor or a physical therapist. That also goes for pain that won‚Äôt go away.\\r\\nBut sometimes you can treat nagging pain and discomfort on your own.\\r\\n\\r\\nOur list of the 4 best back pain relief methods;\\r\\n1. Keep Moving\\r\\nYou might not feel like it when you‚Äôre in pain. But this is probably the first thing your doctor will recommend.\\r\\nA common misconception in patients with isolated back pain is that they can‚Äôt stay active. Try to keep up with your usual level of daily activity and movement.\\r\\n\\r\\n2. Stretch and Strengthen\\r\\nStrong muscles, especially in your abdominal core, help support your back. Strength and flexibility may help both relieve your pain and prevent it. Yoga, Pilates, and tai chi are just a few of the ways to strengthen your core and the muscles around your hips. Exercise can definitely help.\\r\\n\\r\\n3. Keep Good Posture\\r\\nThis helps ease the pressure on your lower back.\\r\\n\\r\\n4. Maintain a Healthy Weight\\r\\nShedding extra pounds lightens the load on your lower back. Weight loss really helps with back pain because it reduces the amount of mechanical force onto the spine.\\r\\n\\r\\nMany people who are exploring chronic back pain management can be hesitant to start a pain journal because they worry it will occupy too much of their time. However, you do not have to document every moment you experience pain for this practice to be worthwhile. You should simply make an effort to add information to your pain journal at specific times of the day. Establishing this routine can help you remember to write in your journal on a daily basis. Writing a few times a day also allows you to record what you are experiencing in more detail than if you only create a single entry for the same period.',\n",

              "   'Description': 'The human back is composed of a complex structure of muscles, ligaments, tendons, disks, and bones, which work together to support the body and enable us to move around.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe segments of the spine are cushioned with cartilage-like pads called disks.\\r\\n\\r\\nProblems with any of these components can lead to back pain. In some cases of back pain, its cause remains unclear.\\r\\n\\r\\nDamage can result from strain, medical conditions, and poor posture, among others.\\r\\n\\r\\nStrain\\r\\nBack pain commonly stems from strain, tension, or injury. Frequent causes of back pain are:\\r\\n\\r\\nstrained muscles or ligaments\\r\\na muscle spasm\\r\\nmuscle tension\\r\\ndamaged disks\\r\\ninjuries, fractures, or falls\\r\\nActivities that can lead to strains or spasms include:\\r\\n\\r\\nlifting something improperly\\r\\nlifting something that is too heavy\\r\\nmaking an abrupt and awkward movement\\r\\nStructural problems\\r\\nA number of structural problems may also result in back pain.\\r\\n\\r\\nRuptured disks: Each vertebra in the spine is cushioned by disks. If the disk ruptures there will be more pressure on a nerve, resulting in back pain.\\r\\nBulging disks: In much the same way as ruptured disks, a bulging disk can result in more pressure on a nerve.\\r\\nSciatica: A sharp and shooting pain travels through the buttock and down the back of the leg, caused by a bulging or herniated disk pressing on a nerve.\\r\\nArthritis: Osteoarthritis can cause problems with the joints in the hips, lower back, and other places. In some cases, the space around the spinal cord narrows. This is known as spinal stenosis.\\r\\nAbnormal curvature of the spine: If the spine curves in an unusual way, back pain can result. An example is scoliosis, in which the spine curves to the side.\\r\\nOsteoporosis: Bones, including the vertebrae of the spine, become brittle and porous, making compression fractures more likely.\\r\\nKidney problems: Kidney stones or kidney infection can cause back pain.\\r\\nMovement and posture\\r\\nBack pain can also result from some everyday activities or poor posture.\\r\\n\\r\\nExamples include:\\r\\n\\r\\ntwisting\\r\\ncoughing or sneezing\\r\\nmuscle tension\\r\\nover-stretching\\r\\nbending awkwardly or for long periods\\r\\npushing, pulling, lifting, or carrying something\\r\\nstanding or sitting for long periods\\r\\nstraining the neck forward, such as when driving or using a computer\\r\\nlong driving sessions without a break, even when not hunched\\r\\nsleeping on a mattress that does not support the body and keep the spine straight\\r\\nOther causes\\r\\nSome medical conditions can lead to back pain.\\r\\n\\r\\nCauda equina syndrome: The cauda equine is a bundle of spinal nerve roots that arise from the lower end of the spinal cord. Symptoms include a dull pain in the lower back and upper buttocks, as well as numbness in the buttocks, genitalia, and thighs. There are sometimes bowel and bladder function disturbances.\\r\\nCancer of the spine: A tumor on the spine may press against a nerve, resulting in back pain.\\r\\nInfection of the spine: A Fever and a tender, warm area on the back could be due to an infection of the spine.\\r\\nOther infections: Pelvic inflammatory disease, bladder, or kidney infections may also lead to back pain.\\r\\nSleep disorders: Individuals with sleep disorders are more likely to experience back pain, compared with others.\\r\\nShingles: An infection that can affect the nerves may lead to back pain. This depends on which nerves are affected.',\n",

              "   'Description': 'The best treatment for one patient may be different from the one that works best on average. Guidelines and conventional decision aids provide average treatment effects and suggestions based on the average patient. However, each patient has unique characteristics that may affect benefits and risks. Back Pain Tracker is an interactive app that helps personalize treatment.\\r\\n\\r\\nBack pain is a major and growing source of pain and disability.  The Institute of Medicine included ‚ÄúComparing the effectiveness of treatment strategies for low back pain without neurological deficit or spinal deformity‚Äù in the top quartile of 100 research priorities in 2009. In U.S. national surveys, LBP is the most frequent type of pain, reported by about half of adults in the past year.  It accounts for 34 million office visits annually to primary care physicians. An estimated 7 million adults have activity limitations due to low back pain. It is considered one of the most vexing health problems of our time. Back pain most commonly occurs without leg numbness or weakness and cannot be reliably attributed to a specific cause (‚Äúnon-specific back pain‚Äù). The optimal strategy for treating such patients is uncertain. The efficacy of treatments is moderate at best. A significant proportion develop persistent disabling pain despite use of first-line therapies such as analgesics, exercise therapy, or cognitive behavioral therapy. Invasive treatments and surgery have limited efficacy and significant risks. Our goal is to help each patient with back pain choose the treatment that is right for them, and engage patients for long term self-assessment using Patient Reported Outcomes (PRO)scores, potentially for more than 5 years, when many patients start reporting deterioration in pain and function following back surgery. BPT has the potential to help improve outcomes for patients with back pain.\\r\\n\\r\\nBPT as an interactive technology to help patients with personalized Shared Decision Making (SDM) in conjunction with their healthcare providers on the appropriateness of the wide range of treatments available for back pain. Too frequently patients are unable to match their treatment decisions with their preferences because they do not fully understand the risks and benefits of the different options. Patients frequently hold mistaken beliefs about their diagnosis and risks/benefits associated with treatments. BPT helps align an individual patient‚Äôs values and preferences with the patient‚Äôs treatment choice through SDM. Unique features of great significance in the BPT are: (1) providing patients with information that balances risks and benefits of treatment options, (2) eliciting preferences based on realistic goals of care, and (3) integrating PROs in the decision-making process at the point-of-care.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe application was developed through a user-centered design approach to design the user interface for ease of use by patients in entering PRO data and to present time-trended PROs that are understandable for patients, including personalized estimates of normative outcomes based on patients‚Äô age, sex and other features. Integration of PROs in the decision-making process at the point-of-care and helping patients directly understand and use benchmarked PRO scores are important novel aspects of our approach. PROs developed by the NIH Task Force on Research Standards for Chronic Low Back Pain and the NIH Patient Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System Computer Adaptive Tests (PROMIS CATs) interact with and ‚Äúfeed‚Äù the SDM process. In particular, the integration of individual patient factors adds to the risk/benefit discussion in the decision for surgery. The scientific premise for BPT is supported by strong clinical evidence and preliminary works. This type of system has been shown to improve patient knowledge and engage the patient for more personalized care. SDM can reduce rates of discretionary surgery and improve patient satisfaction.',\n",

              "   'Description': 'TrackActive Me is an application to self-treat and prevent common injuries and conditions. It has been developed by world-leading clinicians and technologists to help people access convenient and cost-effective care for spines, joints and muscles. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe application is suitable for people with or without an injury or condition. \\r\\n\\r\\nFor those seeking help for a painful condition, a chatbot asks you questions about your condition and then analyses your answers to provide the likely diagnosis of your problem. The assessments have been approved through a process undertaken by a leading London University.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe app then provides video-based exercise programs and advice that has been designed from the best available scientific evidence. For every exercise prescribed in the app there is a link to information showing why that particular exercise is effective for treating a condition like yours. Furthermore, the analysis of the outcomes of 100,000 rehabilitation programs has been used to inform the decision on what exercises to include in treatment programs.\\r\\n\\r\\nIf you are seeking programs to strengthen muscles or improve mobility, our assessment can personalise a program just for you. You can also add a variety of Pilates, yoga, stretching and mobility programs to your routine. All of the programs require minimal equipment so they are perfect for doing at home.\\r\\n\\r\\nYour exercise program progresses with your feedback. So if an exercise or program isn‚Äôt quite right for you, or it‚Äôs becoming too easy, the app will adjust the program to be more suitable.\\r\\n\\r\\nLog and track your strength and aerobic physical activity each week to help you reach your goals, and compare with World Health Organization guidelines. You can add reminders to keep on track, record your symptoms to check your progress and request appointments to see or speak to a real physiotherapist. You can also integrate with the Health app so you can monitor your daily steps within the app.\\r\\n\\r\\nIf you sign-up directly through the application and wish to continue using the app, we will ask you to sign up for a 7-day trial of a monthly or annual subscription. After that period ends you will be charged. You can cancel your subscription at any time.\\r\\n\\r\\nSUBSCRIPTION AND TERMS\\r\\nTrackActive Me offers monthly and yearly auto-renewing subscription options. When you select a subscription you will receive a 7 day free trial and if you cancel within 7 days you will not be charged. \\r\\n\\r\\nYou pay the fixed price for your country, which is displayed in the app. Pricing may vary and actual charges may be converted to your local currency depending on the country of residence.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe subscription will automatically renew unless turned off in your Google Play Account Settings at least 24 hours before the current period ends.

This pain log app will help you keep track of your pain not to have to rely on your memory. A pain log tracks degree of pain, symptoms, and medications, and activities that cause discomfort.

Moreover, there is a higher risk of mental health issues, such as depression and anxiety. Keeping track of one‚Äôs pain in a pain log can be beneficial, in the sense that it will guide the diagnosis in the right direction and it will help one‚Äôs physician recommend more adequate treatment solutions. By keeping a diary of your pain, you might be able to discover if stress, sleep deprivation or weather changes have contributed to your symptoms or not. \\r\\n\\r\\nThis diary is ideal for;\\r\\n- complaints / pain in your back, shoulders or neck.\\r\\n- fibromyalgia, rheumatism and arthritis\\r\\n- chronic pain\\r\\n\\r\\nA pain diary can play an instrumental role in the management of chronic pain and help health professionals to gain a comprehensive understanding of the pain experienced by the patient. This helps to avoid gaps in the history, and certain patterns that can be addressed with or without pharmacological intervention can be implemented.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe benefits of a pain diary are clear and it is evident that recording the characteristics and changes of your pain can help to improve overall management. Keeping a pain diary can assist to:\\r\\n- Establish patterns of pain (e.g. flare ups at certain times, temperatures or after activities)\\r\\n- Understand effective management techniques (e.g. which therapies provide best pain relief)\\r\\n- Improve patient-practitioner communication (e.g. more comprehensive information to make therapeutic decisions)\\r\\n\\r\\nIt is not necessary to note every moment that pain is experienced, which could be counterproductive due to increased focus on pain and higher rates of non-adherence.\\r\\n\\r\\nInstead, it is recommended to make an entry in the diary at certain times throughout the day, often in the morning, midday and before bed. This helps to maintain a regular record of events that provides valuable information about pain and its management. Additionally, it limits the recording of pain to certain times and should not lead to an increased focus on pain at other times of the day.',\n",

              "   'Description': 'One of the biggest pieces of advice people with chronic back pain hear is to keep track of their pain each day. It‚Äôs actually a good tip: That way, you can remember your triggers and identify trends over time, which can help you figure out which medications and treatments are working, and even potentially learn more about what‚Äôs causing your back pain. Another huge advantage: pain tracking helps you give a more detailed picture of your health to your doctor.\\r\\n\\r\\n<b>Keeping a journal can help you manage your chronic pain and pinpoint your most successful treatment options. </b>\\r\\nBack pain is one of the most common physical ailments. Studies show that eight in 10 Americans have back pain at some point in their lives, usually in the lower back.\\r\\n\\r\\nYour might have sprained it while working in the yard or cleaning house. Or your back might hurt from an old sports injury or a chronic condition such as arthritis or ankylosing spondylitis.\\r\\nSudden or severe back pain should be checked by a doctor or a physical therapist. That also goes for pain that won‚Äôt go away.\\r\\nBut sometimes you can treat nagging pain and discomfort on your own.\\r\\n\\r\\nOur list of the 4 best back pain relief methods;\\r\\n1. Keep Moving\\r\\nYou might not feel like it when you‚Äôre in pain. But this is probably the first thing your doctor will recommend.\\r\\nA common misconception in patients with isolated back pain is that they can‚Äôt stay active. Try to keep up with your usual level of daily activity and movement.\\r\\n\\r\\n2. Stretch and Strengthen\\r\\nStrong muscles, especially in your abdominal core, help support your back. Strength and flexibility may help both relieve your pain and prevent it. Yoga, Pilates, and tai chi are just a few of the ways to strengthen your core and the muscles around your hips. Exercise can definitely help.\\r\\n\\r\\n3. Keep Good Posture\\r\\nThis helps ease the pressure on your lower back.\\r\\n\\r\\n4. Maintain a Healthy Weight\\r\\nShedding extra pounds lightens the load on your lower back. Weight loss really helps with back pain because it reduces the amount of mechanical force onto the spine.\\r\\n\\r\\nMany people who are exploring chronic back pain management can be hesitant to start a pain journal because they worry it will occupy too much of their time. However, you do not have to document every moment you experience pain for this practice to be worthwhile. You should simply make an effort to add information to your pain journal at specific times of the day. Establishing this routine can help you remember to write in your journal on a daily basis. Writing a few times a day also allows you to record what you are experiencing in more detail than if you only create a single entry for the same period.',\n",

It increases blood circulation to muscle thus boost optimum oxygen supply.\\r\\nAnother advantage of back exercise is that the motion helps lubricate the facet joints, which are synovial joints that need proper motion.\\r\\n\\r\\n<b>3. Pranayama</b>\\r\\nThe breath is an essential part of yoga practice and pranayama is the formal practice of regulating the breath. PRANA means life force, energy or Qi, & AYAMA is the sanskrit word for ‚Äòextension‚Äô. In Chinese Medicine the concept of prana (or Qi) is defined as energy on the verge of materializing.\\r\\nBy breathing more deeply within the pranayama practice, we are boosting more oxygen to the tissues and breaking this cycle. We can also use our breath as a way to calm our nervous system. Extending the exhalation so that it is longer than the inhalation reduces the resting level of the sympathetic nervous system so that the parasympathetic nervous system can conserve energy and we can feel more relaxed.\\r\\n\\r\\n<b>Features:</b>\\r\\n- 3D model animation yoga & exercise training\\r\\n- Easy to understand home-based yoga, workouts & exercise\\r\\n- Personal trainer to keep track of daily back pain relief plan\\r\\n- Addition in-detail videos to understand Yoga poses, Pranayama & Exercises better way\\r\\n- Pain relief blogs for additional daily tips on Back pain therapy\\r\\n- More customize plans for each user\\r\\n- Nonveg / Veg / Vegan diet for all kind of users.\\r\\n- Daily workout and diet tracker\\r\\n- Daily reminder to keep you on track\\r\\n\\r\\n<b><u>Easy, helpful and FREE!</u></b> What are you waiting for?\\r\\nWishing you Happy Backpain Free Journey with us‚Ä¶ Enjoy‚Ä¶\\r\\nFind out even more at http://www.drzio.com.\\r\\n\\r\\n<b>Disclaimer</b>\\r\\nPlease make note that this product is not at all replacement of any medicine\\xa0or any of present therapy.

              "   'Description': '‚ÄúOvercoming pain based on EMDR‚Äù was brought to you by Mark Grant, well known Australian psychologist/researcher and writer. Mark is particularly interested in developing resources that sufferers of pain and stress can use to make a real difference in their suffering. He is motivated to do what works best for his clients rather than what the ‚Äòaccepted wisdom‚Äô might say. But he maintains a scientific approach and has conducted several studies regarding the efficacy of EMDR as a treatment for chronic pain. \\r\\n\\r\\n‚ÄúOvercoming pain based on EMDR‚Äù mobile application is using recent discoveries from brain science to alleviate chronic pain and severe stress. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe application comprises 3 playlists for controlling pain and associated stress that can maintain pain. \\r\\n\\r\\nEach playlist is designed with different goals in mind. Where the first playlist called ‚ÄúMental Healing strategies‚Äù is aimed to alleviate mild or moderate chronic pain, the second playlist called ‚ÄúSensory Healing strategies‚Äù will help when you are too tired, sore or distressed to employ the pain pathway strategy from the first playlist. And the last playlist called ‚ÄúStress Management‚Äù is focused on reducing your stressful feelings that can maintain and exacerbate chronic pain. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe playlists are designed to compliment each other; so if your pain is severe using the strategies in ‚ÄúSensory Healing strategies‚Äù should help bring it under control enough for you to benefit from the tracks in ‚ÄúMental Healing strategies‚Äù and listening to the ‚ÄúStress Management‚Äù tracks regularly, when your pain is tolerable, will bring your overall stress levels down and decrease the pain-related activity in your body and your brain. The tracks in ‚ÄúMental Healing strategies‚Äù and ‚ÄúStress management‚Äù can be listened to anywhere anytime, but the tracks in ‚ÄúSensory Healing strategies‚Äù require external materials and preparation.\\r\\n\\r\\nOne of the key elements of this app is bilateral stimulation (bls), which is derived from EMDR (Eye Movement Desensitization and Reprocessing). In conjunction with focused attention bls uses sensory stimulation to change physical emotional and cognitive processes associated with chronic pain (as well as trauma and stress). \\r\\n\\r\\nFor best results you should listen to the tracks that incorporate bls with headphones or hear-buds. You can use the app anytime anywhere but a quiet environment when you don‚Äôt feel too overwhelmed by stress or physical discomfort is best. \\r\\n\\r\\nIf you don‚Äôt get the response you expect when listening to the tracks never force yourself or get frustrated, just relax and trust that the relief you are seeking will happen sooner or later.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhile every effort has been made to provide a genuinely useful resource this app should not be considered a substitute for professional advice or treatment. In addition to standard medical care you should at the consider seeking psychotherapy, improving your diet, exercising regularly etc. \\r\\nFor curious minds there‚Äôs a number of articles presented in the application where you can read more about both EMDR and chronic pain and bilateral stimulation healing effect. \\r\\nYou can also read more about chronic pain and how to overcome it from the Mark Grant‚Äôs book called ‚ÄúChange Your Brain Change Your Pain‚Äù which you can also order by following the link in ‚ÄúOvercoming pain based on EMDR‚Äù placed under ‚ÄúOther Resources‚Äù section.',\n",

Your pain is chronic and complicated. You can‚Äôt remember everything. You want your doctors to understand, but you don‚Äôt know how to explain what you feel.\\r\\n\\r\\nPAIN IS LIFE-CHANGING. HELP IS HERE.\\r\\nNanolume¬Æ developed the Pain Tracker & Diary to help you record the daily textures, intensities, and locations of what you feel, so you and your care team can better understand what you are suffering with and follow how your pain responds to medications and treatments.\\r\\n\\r\\nTRACK IT BETTER. TREAT IT BETTER.\\r\\nPain is a complex experience. It often includes multiple pain types (layers), each with its own unique texture, intensity, location, and surface area.\\r\\n\\r\\nBy keeping a diary that integrates complex information, you can show your doctors what you are experiencing to help them make a better diagnosis, choose more appropriate medications and treatments, and monitor if your treatments are beneficial. In addition, by keeping such an integrated record, trends might emerge that would otherwise go unnoticed.  \\r\\n\\r\\nPAIN IS DIFFERENT.\\r\\nPain is a subjective (not objective) sensation that you cannot measure. Its assessment relies on each person‚Äôs ability to communicate what they feel. Nanolume¬Æ developed this digital diary to help you record what you feel every day. \\r\\n\\r\\nINCLUDED FEATURES.\\r\\nFor each diary entry you create:\\r\\n‚Ä¢ Choose a Pain Type. Choose from a list of predefined pain types or create a customized pain type. Next, tap the icon of the pain type you feel is most intense (you can come back and add more types later).\\r\\n‚Ä¢ Select the Intensity. Select the intensity of your pain type using a Numeric Rating Scale (NRS).\\r\\n‚Ä¢ Draw an Outline. Use your finger to draw an ‚Äúoutline‚Äù of the type of pain you are experiencing on the front and back sides of a generalized map of your body.\\r\\n‚Ä¢ Calculated Surface Areas. The app displays the percent [%] of your body surface affected by each (or all) of the pain types you draw.\\r\\n‚Ä¢ Zoom. Need to see a larger image of your hand or foot? Double-tap: once to zoom x2; twice to zoom x4; a third time to restore the original size.\\r\\n‚Ä¢ Notes. Tap the ‚ÄúNotepad‚Äù icon located in the top-left corner of each opened diary entry to record any details of your medications or treatment results.\\r\\n‚Ä¢ Tap \"Add Pain.\" Choose another pain type (layer) to draw.\\r\\n‚Ä¢ Save Your Diary Entry. Tap \"Done\" to create a snapshot of all the pain type layers you drew. The app attaches the date and time your entry was saved.\\r\\n‚Ä¢ Open a Saved Entry. Tap on the date and time of the entry you want to review. Look at the intensity, location, and surface area of each pain type you experienced (by touching the icon of the pain type you want to see) or see all the pain types at once and see how they overlap (tap the \"All Layers\" icon). Swipe the picture left or right to check how your other pain entries compare over time.\\r\\n‚Ä¢ Charts. View a summary of your data in \"Charts.\"\\r\\n‚Ä¢ Forget to Save an Entry? Go back and recreate a \"pain picture\" from the past; then, use the \"Calendar\" icon to backdate the recreated entry.\\r\\n‚Ä¢ Calendar Backdating. Touch the \"Calendar\" icon to backdate any pain-picture you draw to create a record of what you remember from the past.\\r\\n‚Ä¢ Copy/Edit. Copy or edit a copy of a previous entry.\\r\\n‚Ä¢ CSV Export. Email or save a numeric file of your data, then open that data in a spreadsheet.\\r\\n‚Ä¢ Interactive Summary & Animation. Play an animation of your data to see how your pain types change within any period you choose by selecting the corresponding start/stop dates.\\r\\n‚Ä¢ PDF Export.

              "   'Description': \"<b>How to Relieve Back Pain</b>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nPerhaps you bent the wrong way while lifting something heavy. Or you're dealing with a degenerative condition like arthritis. Whatever the cause, once you have low back pain, it can be hard to shake. About one in four Americans say they've had a recent bout of low back pain. And almost everyone can expect to experience back pain at some point in their lives.\\r\\n\\r\\nSometimes, it‚Äôs clearly serious: You were injured, or you feel numbness, weakness, or tingling in the legs. Call the doctor, of course. But for routine and mild low back pain, here are a few simple tips to try at home.\\r\\n\\r\\n<b>Chill it.</b> Ice is best in the first 24 to 48 hours after an injury because it reduces inflammation.\\r\\n\\r\\n<b>Keep moving.</b> Our spines are like the rest of our body -- they're meant to move. Keep doing your daily activities. Make the beds, go to work, walk the dog. Once you're feeling better, regular aerobic exercises like swimming, bicycling, and walking can keep you -- and your back -- more mobile. Just don't overdo it. There's no need to run a marathon when your back is sore.\\r\\n\\r\\n<b>Stay strong.</b> Once your low back pain has receded, you can help avert future episodes of back pain by working the muscles that support your lower back, including the back extensor muscles. Having strong hip, pelvic, and abdominal muscles also gives you more back support. Avoid abdominal crunches, because they can actually put more strain on your back.\\r\\n\\r\\n<b>Ways to Manage Low Back Pain at Home</b>\\r\\n\\r\\n<b>Sleep Better:</b> When you have back pain, sleeping can be hard. It can be a vicious cycle because when you don't get enough sleep, your back pain may feel worse. A poor sleep position can also aggravate back pain. \\r\\n\\r\\n<b>Good Posture:</b> Grandma was right! Slouching is bad for you. And poor posture can make back pain worse, especially if you sit for long periods. \\r\\n\\r\\n<b>Physical Therapy</b>\\r\\nPhysical therapists can teach you how to sit, stand, and move in a way that keeps your spine in proper alignment and alleviates strain on your back.\\r\\n\\r\\n‚úÖ back pain relief\\r\\n‚úÖ lower back pain relief\\r\\n‚úÖ sciatica relief\\r\\n‚úÖ sciatic nerve relief\",\n",

As it it is considered a medical device that poses minimal risk to patients and consumers, it falls under the FDA exercise enforcement discretions.

You can also edit the information you submitted to see how this influences your results.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe lifetime probabilities of developing cancers were based on USA data from the National Cancer Institute's (NCI's) Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) Program, collected since 1973 and by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's (CDC's) National Program of Cancer Registries (NPCR), collected since 1995.

Risk factors requiring complex tests not available to the average clinician were excluded. Meta-analyses were given preference when available.\\r\\n\\r\\nDISCLAIMER: This application is strictly educational and all information contained herein cannot and should not replace assessment by a physician. The evaluations presented represent our best efforts to conveniently assess cancer risk. However, as significant controversy and widely different study results can persist around the impact of even a single variable in a strictly selected population, this is based on a large number of assumptions, extrapolations and estimates. As not every study includes a multivariate analysis and the effect of some risk factors on certain cancers is so large their effect cannot be eliminated from basic probability, a bias toward overestimation of risk is possible. Furthermore, there is continuous progress in the scientific literature.

              "   'Description': 'The easiest, least expensive way to reduce your risk for cancer is just by eating a healthy diet. When it comes to a diet rich in cancer-fighting substances, most experts agree that it should consist of a predominantly plant-based diet. \"If you have two-thirds of plant food on your plate, that seems to be enough to avoid excessive amounts of food high in saturated fat. That seemingly simple advice could mean a drastic change in diet for many people.\\r\\n\\r\\nPeople who are thinking that this is like a diet, and are trying to choke this stuff down, it\\'s never going to last. You\\'re looking at creating something for a lifetime. If it takes you awhile, but each month or so you enjoy [one more vegetable], then that\\'s great.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe extracts from cruciferous vegetables as well as those from vegetables of the genus Allium inhibited the proliferation of all tested cancer cell lines whereas extracts from vegetables most commonly consumed in Western countries were much less effective. The antiproliferative effect of vegetables was specific to cells of cancerous origin and was found to be largely independent of their antioxidant properties. These results thus indicate that vegetables have very different inhibitory activities towards cancer cells and that the inclusion of cruciferous and Allium vegetables in the diet is essential for effective dietary-based chemopreventive strategies.\\r\\n\\r\\nTranslation:\\r\\n- Allium and cruciferous veggies stopped cancer growth.\\r\\n- Commonly consumed vegetables did not work as well.\\r\\n- The antioxidant content of veggies was not a key anti-cancer factor.\\r\\n- Different vegetables work for different cancers.\\r\\n- Allium and cruciferous veggies should be eaten to prevent cancer.\\r\\nSo the most commonly consumed vegetables in Western countries had very little effect on cancer cell growth. The top three (potatoes, lettuce and carrots) account for 60% of the vegetables we Westerners are eating. 32% of our vegetable intake is potatoes, and half of that is actually french fries. Dark greens, cruciferous veggies and garlic account for less than 1% of our Western diet!\\r\\n\\r\\nRadishes were shown to stop tumor growth by 95-100% for breast and stomach cancer, but had no effect and may have even increased tumor growth by 20-25% in pancreatic, brain, lung and kidney cancer. Definitely something to keep in mind.\\r\\n\\r\\nYou may want to start with some of the following food substances, all of which show promise as cancer-fighting agents.\\r\\n\\r\\nTake this list to your next grocery visit, and stock up on these cancer fighting ingredients. And remember to make fruits, vegetables, beans and whole grains the biggest part of every meal. Add some of these healthy foods to your diet to help prevent cancer and keep other diseases at bay.',\n",

Skincare performed without medical intervention will help to get rid of jowls & oedema, wrinkles on the forehead & nasolabial folds. You can download the ‚ÄòforYou‚Äô app designed for the best skincare and facial exercises completely free of charge. Practice face-building for 2-3 weeks 10 minutes a day and you will recognise significant positive changes on your skin. It will become softer & more elastic, able to resist new wrinkles.\\r\\n \\r\\nFace-Yoga & self-massage using your own hands without an electric massager can replace expensive cosmetic procedures like lymphatic drainage and lifting. Ultimately facial gymnastics helps to avoid spending vast amounts of money on plastic surgery and painful injections. Apply facial acupressure and pinch massage to get rid of forehead wrinkles and sagging skin. Additionally face-building helps to restore natural skin complexion.\\r\\n \\r\\nLifting facial massage is a mandatory procedure for people aged over 30. With age skin loses its elasticity & is unable to recover conditions as quickly as young skin. Our application shows you how to carry out facial care massages & and teaches special techniques how to perform skincare exercises yourself. Perform Face Gymnastics with forYou for 15-20 minutes a day to effectively increase skin elasticity and immediately improve skin tone. Home facial massage technique we offer is suitable for men and women of any age. We have only selected safe & effective facial exercises that can help to achieve a sustainable positive result if you do it regularly.\\r\\n \\r\\nForYou will help to master facial massage on the go & will organically fit face building in your tight schedule. Using the methods of manual facial massage offered by us you can achieve smoothness and elasticity of the skin, a clear line of cheekbones and chin & a beautiful young skin tone.\\r\\n \\r\\nFace-Yoga is the best way to get rid of puffiness & wrinkles. You can download forYou to start facial acupressure practice right now.\\r\\n \\r\\nFacial massage can be mastered at home with the help of our application in a few simple steps. To get started - download forYou, select facial massage treatment that suits you & learn the techniques. Face Gymnastics techniques are presented in the form of a classic, pinching & plastic complex - implemented Augmented Reality (AR) technology will direct you how to perform these techniques.  \\r\\n \\r\\nAcupressure, classic & pinch facial massage can be performed on dry or moist skin. The app will indicate whether your skin requires oil or cream for the treatment in the description of the complex. Particularly for classic & acupressure facial massage skin needs to be pre-moisturized. Carefully read the recommendations & instructions provided in the application to avoid damaging your delicate skin.\\r\\n \\r\\nForYou provides training on how to master classic facial exercises at home. It takes about 15 minutes to perform the massage treatment. Face-yoga will save your skin from wrinkles and jowls. It will allow you to build the perfect outline of chin & cheekbones. Pinching facial massage performed according to Augmented Reality technique lasts for 10 minutes. Face-building helps to lift the corners of the lips, smooth out the nasolabial folds & tighten the cheeks. Plastic facial massage takes approximately 8 minutes. Same as for the pinched massage technique you can do it without pre-moisturising the skin.\\r\\n \\r\\nAll facial treatments & exercises recommended by professional forYou cosmetologists are available directly in the app. You can share treatments via social networks or instant messengers to get additional options.

For people with diabetes, healthy eating is not simply a matter of what one eats, but also when one eats. Discover delicious, healthy recipes that fit into a diabetic diet. People with diabetes can eat any food that they want, preferably a healthy diet with some carbohydrates, but they need to be more aware of the carbohydrate content of foods and avoid simple sugars like juices and sugar-sweetened beverages.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhether you‚Äôre trying to prevent or control diabetes, your nutritional needs are virtually the same as everyone else, so no special foods are necessary. But you do need to pay attention to some of your food choices, most notably the carbohydrates you eat.

Losing weight and eating healthier can also have a profound effect on your mood, energy, and sense of well being.

The bottom line is that you have more control over your health than you may think.\\r\\n\\r\\nNutrition and physical activity are important parts of a healthy lifestyle when you have diabetes.

Users can also see the graph of HbA1c changes in a year.\\r\\n‚Ä¢\\tGoogle drive integration to keep all the results of glucose monitoring safe and confidential\\r\\n‚Ä¢\\tInterface settings\\r\\n\\r\\nWhat is missing: advertising, paid services, complex \"multi-ways\" to get to the right section, acid colors and other annoying things.\\r\\n\\r\\n<b>Diary</b>\\r\\nEvery diabetic knows that it is necessary to measure blood glucose several times a day. The application has the ability to enter control results:\\r\\n‚Ä¢\\ton an empty stomach and after breakfast\\r\\n‚Ä¢\\tbefore / after lunch and dinner\\r\\nThere is also a column \"Other\", where it is convenient to enter the results of extraordinary measurements - for example, in case of deterioration of health.\\r\\n\\r\\n<b>Notes</b>\\r\\nAfter each measurement, it makes sense to write down exactly what and how much you ate and drank with each meal. You can enter other data - for example, blood pressure, analyzes. These details are also important in their own way. With their help, it is often possible to determine which foods and how they affect not only glucose level, but also blood pressure or other indicators.\\r\\n\\r\\n<b>Archive</b>\\r\\nIn some cases, to track the dynamics of the disease, the data of previous several months or even years are required. The Diabetes Tracker app stores all measurements and notes earlier than three months in an archive.\\r\\nWhen switching to the tab of the same name at the bottom of any of the pages, the user gains access to the old data, which can, for example, be transferred to the physician.\\r\\n\\r\\n<b>Statistics</b>\\r\\nA very important section, where the minimum, average and maximum blood glucose measurements of the last two weeks, one month and three months are saved.\\r\\nBased on them, the average value is displayed. It is automatically converted into the calculated value of glycated hemoglobin - HbA1c. Glycated hemoglobin is one of the most important indicators for determining the success of controlling the course of diabetes of any type.\\r\\nDepending on the result obtained, a rating is given - good, relative or poor control of diabetes. For more convenience and informational content, the assessment is displayed in green, orange or red.\\r\\n\\r\\n<b>Interface settings</b>\\r\\nThe application is customizable at user‚Äôs request. The following settings have been implemented:\\r\\n‚Ä¢\\tDay / night mode (very convenient when you have to measure glucose late in the evening or at night)\\r\\n‚Ä¢\\tThe units of measurement for glucose are in mmol / L and in mg / dL. The first is commonly used in post-Soviet countries, and the second one - in the USA and Western Europe. Quick change of units is especially suitable for people who travel abroad for consultations and treatment\\r\\n\\r\\nAlso, users can back up data and import it from other files.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Diabetes Tracker app follows the Material Design guidelines. Besides, it was created by a medical practitioner, so the interpretation of blood glucose results deserves the patients‚Äô complete confidence.',\n",

RH include issues like abortion, HIV/STIs, maternal health and rights, contraceptive access, gender-based violence, discrimination and stigma and more. Though women with disabilities have the same and sexual and reproductive health needs as other women, they often face barriers to information and services, health rights are often not met. Thus they remain ignorant of basic facts about themselves, their bodies, and their rights to define what they do and do not want. Every individual has the right to make their own choices about their sexual and reproductive health. The challenges are not necessarily part of having a disability, but instead often reflect lack of social attention, legal protection, understanding and support.\\r\\n\\r\\nMobile application (App) platforms have the potential to advance sexual and reproductive health. Digital technologies and mobile platforms provides insight into opportunities to advance Sexual and reproductive health. It has the potential to facilitate innovative, efficient ways meeting growing global health needs.

A large collection of 3D illustrations of dental treatment is sorted into groups and located inside this application.\\r\\n\\r\\nQuick and easy. Many dentists draw illustrations on paper every time explaining the treatment process to their patients, which can take some time. Finding the necessary illustration in the application database is very simple- it will take you about 10 seconds. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe 3D illustration is better than a photo. Patients can be shocked and frightened by seeing photographs of blood operations or a real photo of teeth.  If you use 3D illustrations, the patient most likely will perceive such information loyally.\\r\\n\\r\\nQuality and precision. All illustrations are based on accurate anatomy, real procedures, and treatment, based on the support of professional doctors and dental surgeons. \\r\\n\\r\\nAccess to the necessary illustrations will be instant regardless of where you are. This application does not use the Internet traffic to download the illustrations, all necessary 3D illustration files are already contained within the application.\\r\\n\\r\\nUse your materials. You can place your photos in the application using them to demonstrate to your patients. The application does not store your data but only uses the image file from your device in its gallery. \\r\\n \\r\\nThe category of selected illustration topics allows you to access the most frequently used topics even faster. To do this, you will need to transfer the necessary topic to the Favorites section.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe list of topics by category:\\r\\n‚¶Å\\tAnatomy of teeth and jaws. Information schemes. \\r\\n‚¶Å\\tHygiene and teeth whitening. The development of tartar and plaque. Cleaning.  \\r\\n‚¶Å\\tTherapy- dental treatment. Different types of caries. \\r\\n‚¶Å\\tProsthetics. Veneers, Restorations, Bridges, Crowns, Removable prostheses.\\r\\n‚¶Å\\tImplantation. Bone Augmentation. Partial and complete rehabilitation of teeth.  \\r\\n‚¶Å\\tOrthodontics. Braces, Occlusion, Congenital and acquired defects.\\r\\n‚¶Å\\tPeriodontology. Various gum problems and their treatment.\\r\\n‚¶Å\\tSurgery. Extractions, Hemisection, Sinus-lifting, Bone Augmentation.  \\r\\n\\r\\nThe gallery works on the principle of the slideshow presentation. You open a topic you are interested in, the topic itself can contain 3-9 images. You choose the most suitable illustration and show to the patient and consult him. Next, you can switch the related images from the topic while you continue to consult. \\r\\n\\r\\nUsing a TV for a demonstration. Read the instructions of your TV and smartphone, most likely you have the opportunity to broadcast on a large TV display. This can probably be implemented as a duplication of the display.\\r\\n\\r\\nI am constantly working on improving the application creating new illustrations. Please tell us what new topics you might be interested in.\\r\\n\\r\\nSincerely, Alex Mit.',\n",

By maintaining proper dental hygiene and adhering to all recommendations within the app, you will receive incentives in the form of Dentacoin (DCN) - the first cryptocurrency for the global dental industry. The Dentacare Mobile app aims to form long-lasting dental care habits through an intensive training program in an engaging gamified environment.\\r\\n\\r\\nResearch by the Australian Dental Association shows us that nowadays, more than 90% of all dental problems can be prevented with regular check-ups, proper oral care and nutrition. This well-known but often missed real-world problem is about to meet its match by facing the new mobile app from Dentacoin. \\r\\n\\r\\nThrough reminders, notifications, voice navigation and tutorials, you will be taught how to improve your dental hygiene and thus, form healthy dental care habits. The app educates you on how to brush, floss and rinse properly, but also provides further recommendations on how to properly take care of your teeth, by means of regular check-ups, better nutrition and so on. \\r\\nFurthermore the implemented emergency function allows you to get advice from dental specialists within the Dentacoin network, should you be unable to consult your dentist on time. The app is tremendously beneficial for children as well, as forming dental hygiene habits at a young age prevents serious complications in the future.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe basic program lasts 3 months, as science shows us that this is how much time people need to permanently develop a habit. Once you‚Äôve finished training consistently for three months, you are free to withdraw your hard-earned Dentacoin and exchange it for dental services, dental care products, Dentacoin Assurance, or simply trade it on exchange platforms against other currencies.

While there are no effective <b>eye exercises</b> for astigmatism, myopia, or hyperopia, otherwise known as refractive errors, eye exercises can help with optimising visual skills. Vision therapy, a type of physical therapy for the eyes, has been shown to improve certain conditions involving eye alignment and focusing. During <b>vision therapy</b>, a patient is prescribed a set of eye exercises for lazy eye, among other conditions. While being under an eye doctor‚Äôs care can provide more guidance on how to use eye exercises, there are some eye muscle exercises that can be done at home. While I wouldn‚Äôt expect these eye exercises to improve vision fast, with diligence, they can gradually help with focusing issues and eyestrain.\",\n",

              "   'Description': 'COVIDWISE is the official COVID-19 exposure notification app for the Commonwealth of Virginia‚Äôs Department of Health (VDH).  The app was developed in partnership with SpringML using a Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) API framework created through a unique collaboration between Apple and Google.\\r\\n\\r\\nYour personal use of COVIDWISE will significantly help inform Virginians suspected of having been within close proximity to someone with a positive COVID-19 diagnosis. When you download COVIDWISE, you are doing your part to efficiently and effectively help your community stay ahead of any potential resurgent trends in cases. This is vitally important as the business sector, healthcare industry, K-12 schools, institutions of higher education, religious organizations, sporting/recreation activities, and others rely on appropriate interventions to ensure the health of our communities and maintain economic viability. \\r\\n\\r\\nHow COVIDWISE Works: \\r\\nIf someone reports to the app that they tested positive, the signals from their app will search for other app users who shared that signal. The BLE signals are date-stamped and the app estimates how close the two devices were based on signal strength. If the timeframe was at least 15 minutes and the estimated distance was within six feet, then the other user receives a notification of a possible exposure. No names! No location! \\r\\n\\r\\nThe BLE framework within COVIDWISE will run in the background, even if the exposure notification app is closed. It will not drain the device battery at a rate that would occur with other apps that use normal Bluetooth and/or are open and running constantly.\\r\\n\\r\\nHow COVIDWISE Protects Your Privacy:\\r\\nVDH takes your privacy and confidentiality very seriously. This is why we chose to use the Apple and Google BLE framework. No personal data or location tracking occurs within this app. In fact, there is no need for VDH to know where or who you are for COVIDWISE to work. If you are close enough to another app user, the BLE technology will share signals with that user. \\r\\n\\r\\nLaboratory results for all persons who test positive for COVID-19 are sent to VDH. This is not associated with the app. Our staff follows up with persons reported as positive, based on information provided within the laboratory report. \\r\\n\\r\\nAnonymously Share Positive Test Results With COVIDWISE:\\r\\nWhen VDH receives any positive COVID-19 lab result registered with a valid mobile phone number, we will automatically send a text message to that individual, which provides rapid notification and encourages them to stay home and away from other people. The text also lets individuals who have tested positive know they may retrieve an 8-digit verification code from the COVIDWISE Verification Portal at https://apps.vdh.virginia.gov/CWP. You must enter your last name, date of birth, and the phone number that matches the information from your registered COVID-19 test to verify your positive result.\\r\\n\\r\\nYou may use that 8-digit verification code in order to anonymously report a positive result to the app. This prevents people from falsely reporting positive results, which could generate false exposure notifications. VDH wants all app users to feel confident that when a possible COVID-19 exposure is received via the app, that it is a real event. \\r\\n\\r\\nIf you have the current Apple or Google operating system installed on your device, you may have noticed that Exposure Notifications are now included. Apple and Google will delete the exposure notification service tools from their respective operating systems once the pandemic reaches a point that public health no longer requires the use of this technology.\\r\\n\\r\\nThank you for downloading COVIDWISE! Together, we can protect our family, friends, neighbors, and colleagues, and keep Virginia moving forward!',\n",

              "   'Description': \"WA Notify is the official COVID-19 exposure-notifications software for Washington State and Department of Health (DOH). The app is an instance of the Exposure Notifications Express platform developed by Apple and Google and configured by DOH.\\r\\n\\r\\nYour voluntary use of WA Notify will help anonymously alert you and fellow users in Washington state who may have been near someone with a positive COVID-19 diagnosis. When you enable WA Notify, you are doing your part to help your community slow the spread of COVID-19. \\r\\n\\r\\nHow WA Notify works:\\r\\nWhen devices with WA Notify are in close contact, they exchange random codes. When someone tells their app they tested positive for COVID-19, other users who received their random codes receive an alert that they may have been exposed to COVID-19. Devices receiving random codes date-stamp them and record their signal strength so the app can estimate how close the devices were and for how long. Users within six feet for 15 minutes or more of the COVID-positive person are notified that they may have been exposed to COVID-19.\\r\\n\\r\\nApple and Google's Exposure Notifications framework runs in the background, even when the WA Notify app is closed. It will not drain the device battery at a rate that would occur with other apps.\\r\\n\\r\\nHow WA Notify Protects Your Privacy:\\r\\nWashington state DOH takes your privacy and confidentiality very seriously. The Apple and Google framework does not link any personal data or location information with the random codes exchanged by devices. DOH does not want or need to know where or who you are for WA Notify to work. When you are close enough to another app user, your device will exchange random codes with that user.\\r\\n\\r\\nState law requires that lab results for all persons who test positive for COVID-19 are sent to Washington state DOH. This is not associated with the app. Public health organizations (DOH or local public health) follow up with those who test positive for COVID-19, based on information provided by testing labs. As a courtesy to all app users, public health organizations will verify positive tests and then provide app users with a verification code. If you choose to share a positive test with the app, you must use that code. This prevents people from falsely reporting. DOH wants app users to feel confident that possible COVID-19 exposure notifications received via the app are legitimate.\\r\\n\\r\\nIf you have the current Apple or Google operating system installed on your device, you may have noticed that Exposure Notifications are now included. You cannot enable this function until you have installed the WA Notify app. Apple and Google will delete the exposure notification service tools from their respective operating systems once the pandemic reaches a point that public health no longer requires the use of this technology.\\r\\n\\r\\nThank you for installing WA Notify! Together, we can protect our family, friends, neighbors, and colleagues, and keep Washington state moving forward!\",\n",

              "   'Description': \"First Aid Kit is a first aid app that equips you with clinical skills and first aid knowledge required to save lives in emergency situations. First Aid Kit has simple step-by-step first aid instructions that you can follow when providing emergency help to an injured victim. The emergency help provided can be the difference between life and death. Hence, emergency first aid is an important skill that everyone should have since no one knows when he or she will be required to provide emergency help.  \\r\\n \\r\\nFirst Aid Kit also has a BMI calculator. The BMI calculator is a scientific calculator used to determine a person's body mass index. To give you your Body Mass Index (BMI), the BMI calculator will require you to provide your height and weight. The BMI calculator will then apply a series of complex formulas to provide height and weight values to come up with an accurate BMI value. The first aid app also provides you with a list of BMI values from the world health organization. The BMI values from the world health organization are categorized as underweight, normal weight, and obese. The world health organization's values are considered to be the conventional world wide standard, hence will help you make informed health and fitness decisions.\\r\\n \\r\\nBesides, First Aid Kit has a medical record section. It is very important for every patient to have a medical record that is updated frequently since the medical record helps to give a snapshot of the patient's health history. As a result, doctors can always rely on the patient's medical record and history when administering treatment. In the medical record section, users can update, edit, and delete their profiles at their convenience.\\r\\n \\r\\n First aid kit is also an important element in emergency first aid. First Aid Kit has some of the common items found in a first aid kit. Most people do not know how to use some of these items, and hence the first aid kit in this app will help educate you on the usage of these tools that will come in handy when you are required to provide emergency first aid. The first aid app also has multiple national emergency phone numbers that you can use when requesting emergency help.\\r\\n \\r\\n The first aid's app health news and health tips section will provide you, with a variety of healthcare information. Healthcare is an important aspect of human lives, hence First Aid Kit will always provide you with up to date health information. The first aid app is also structured in a way that it can also be used to provide lifesaver first aid courses. This makes the first aid app useful to first aid students and trainers since it is an easy and simple to follow first aid guide.\\r\\n \\r\\nWhy chose this smart first aid application?\\r\\n \\r\\n-The provided first aid instructions are simple and easy to understand. Besides, the equivalent video instructions are also provided to help you better understand how to perform the first aid procedure.\\r\\n \\r\\n-The first aid app has Text to speech functionality (TTS) which means the app can read out the instructions, the feature comes in handy especially if one has low vision.\\r\\n \\r\\n-Apart from the first aid instructions, one can also save his or her medical history in the application. The information is stored locally in your mobile phone hence privacy of data is guaranteed.\\r\\n \\r\\n-Easy and smart first aid can also quickly calculate and provide you with your Body Mass Index (BMI). All you need to get the result is to key in your height and weight and get your answer.\\r\\n \\r\\n-The app also has a section for health tips and news. This section will be frequently updated to give users relevant information needed for them to continue to live healthy lifestyles.\\r\\n \\r\\n-The app also has an emergency line section, where a person can quickly contact their national emergency call centers. Each emergency number can only work in their respective country.\",\n",

As a result of those fatal crashes, 36,560 people were killed. In that same year 506 nonoccupants (pedestrians, pedal- cyclists, and others) were killed by distraction-affected crashes. The safe drive mobile app is a tool to help solve this problem that could be used by anyone, is simple to use, and easy to access that also gives a parent or a business the opportunity to assist in monitoring their drivers .',\n",

              "   'Description': 'General Insurance of Cyprus is leading the way again! Their latest innovation, the Drive Safe mobile app, records driving behaviour, helping drivers to become even better on the road and to be more eco-friendly, as well as earning them a discount on the renewal of their insurance. In this way, General Insurance of Cyprus is contributing to the effort by the state to reduce the road traffic accidents. \\r\\n\\r\\nWith Drive Safe, the driver is given information at the end of every journey about their driving behaviour and a score (0 ‚Äì 100). The driver is immediately able to recognise weak areas in their driving and improve on them straight away during their next trip. The driver can also look at their driving behaviour over time and see how it compares with other drivers. At the same time, they can also see whether they will be entitled to a discount on renewal of their insurance Policy with General Insurance of Cyprus. \\r\\n\\r\\nHow does it work\\r\\nUsing the sensors and Location Service of the mobile phone, Drive Safe is able to identify the beginning and end of each journey and evaluate the driving behavior of the user/vehicle. \\r\\nThe score for each trip and the total score of the driver is calculated using the advanced scoring model of Drive Safe which takes into consideration:\\r\\n‚Ä¢ Driving in excess of the speed limit, \\r\\n\\r\\n‚Ä¢ Using the mobile phone whilst driving, \\r\\n\\r\\n‚Ä¢ Braking (sudden and aggressive braking), \\r\\n\\r\\n‚Ä¢ Acceleration (sharp and aggressive acceleration) and\\r\\n\\r\\nDriving during the most dangerous hours (22:00 - 04:00). \\r\\n\\r\\nThe scoring ranges from 0 - 100, with 100 being the optimum.\\r\\n\\r\\nDrive Safe provides the driver with a full and detailed analysis of every trip, pointing out those areas where the driving was not ideal. \\r\\n\\r\\nBattery and internet connection\\r\\n\\r\\nDrive Safe has been designed and developed to ensure minimal battery consumption. When not driving, the expected consumption is negligible (<1% every 24 hours), while when driving, it is 3-5% per hour.\\r\\nDrive Safe does not require an Internet connection to operate. However, to improve the logging process, it is recommended that you have Wi-Fi and / or Data (3G / 4G) enabled.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nPersonal Data\\r\\n\\r\\nThe use of state-of-the-art mobile technology to evaluate driving behaviour requires the use of personal data, an issue which General Insurance of Cyprus takes very seriously and we have ensured that the confidentiality of the data is absolutely secure. \\r\\n\\r\\nBeyond the overall driving score, no one else, other than the user, has access to personally identifiable data (e.g., its routes, detailed driving behaviour). We have ensured the complete separation of the storage of the driving behaviour data (sensor data) from the personal data and no interfacing is feasible.\\r\\nEach process we use is in accordance with General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) of the European Union.',\n",

As there is a growing shortage of taxis in our city, clients are increasingly deciding to go to business dinners, parties, birthdays and all types of celebrations with their own cars. In order not to endanger their safety and the safety of others in traffic, our drivers come to the destination and return the client to the desired location in their own car. The client arrives at home in his car without any risk. Our drivers are responsible and capable guys and your ride will be safe and comfortable.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe application will enable clients to contact us as quickly and easily as possible. There, they will see the estimated waiting time for the driver, contact them when the driver is in front of their car, and then they will be able to choose the method of payment. The application will include driving history, price list of services, current discounts. Until now, clients who drank and wanted to return home safely had to search for phone numbers on various search engines, advertisements and billboards, and now they will have everything on the application on their phone. The purpose of our application is to make it easier for clients to use our services and a faster way to communicate with SAFE DRIVER BG.',\n",

Create your own dispatch center and choose where in the world your fire and police stations are placed, using real life maps. You want to recreate the emergency and rescue system of your city? Or would you prefer to build a huge fire station right on top of the Madison Square Garden? The choice is yours!\\r\\n\\r\\nFirst you start with a fire station and a Type 1 or Type 2 engine. Afterwards you can expand your emergency system any way you want. Add more specialist vehicles like HazMat, Heavy Rescue vehicles, MCV (Mobile Command Vehicle), or build up your police force with SWAT and K9 units - or both and cover all 911 emergency calls!\\r\\n\\r\\nThe game allows for vast customization, so all stations and vehicles can be named. And as some specialized vehicles need trained personnel, you can set up training courses and assign specialists to specific vehicles. Advanced players can use helicopters (HEMS) to get to the most urgent emergencies quickly!\\r\\n\\r\\nIf you enjoy teamwork then help friends by joining or creating an alliance. You can share jobs to help each other out as well as allow friends to take patients to your hospital or prison. The more units you have will boost your call amount too, increasing the challenges you face. Remember, some 911 calls will require different types of units to be sent so ensure your fleet is up-to-date!\\r\\n\\r\\nThis game was developed by a real firefighter. So it was always important to have realistic emergency missions with realistic demands for vehicles - from small missions like a burning car to big ones like a bridge collapse - all on real life maps!   \\r\\n\\r\\nNaturally a lot of our players are also firefighter, police officer, ambulance driver, operator or 911 dispatcher in their real lives. For fans of emergency, rescue, blue light systems this is the perfect game!\\r\\n\\r\\nFinally, we want to let you know that we are always interested in ideas for new missions, vehicles and other content. Just give us a note in a review, contact us on Facebook or send us an email. We cannot implement everything but we strive to realize the valuable input from our players.

              "   'Description': \"First aid is the first and immediate assistance given to any person suffering from either a minor or serious illness or injury, with care provided to preserve life, prevent the condition from worsening, or to promote recovery.\\r\\nFirst aid refers to the emergency or immediate care you should provide when a person is injured or ill until full medical treatment is available. For minor conditions, first aid care may be enough. For serious problems, first aid care should be continued until more advanced care becomes available.\\r\\nFirst aid is vital for saving lives. A person can carry out first aid after a life-threatening incident or injury before the arrival of emergency services.\\r\\nThe aims of first aid are to preserve life, prevent harm, and promote recovery.\\r\\nIn first aid, ABC stands for airway, breathing, and circulation.\\r\\nThe recovery position helps minimize further injury.\\r\\nCPR stands for cardiopulmonary resuscitation. It helps maintain the flow of oxygenated blood.\\r\\nWhile doing chest compressions, you may hear cracks. This is normal.\\r\\nFirst aid is an emergency measure, generally consisting of simple, often life-saving techniques that most people can train to perform with minimal equipment and no previous medical experience.\\r\\nFirst aid is not classed as medical treatment and does not replace interventions from a trained medical professional.\\r\\nAt any moment, you or someone around you could experience an injury or illness. Using basic first aid, you may be able to stop a minor mishap from getting worse. In the case of a serious medical emergency, you may even save a life.\\r\\nFirst aid covers the steps taken to help an injured or sick person in the first minutes after the event.\\r\\n\\r\\nOften this first aid can help someone feel better, recover more quickly, and can even save lives.\\r\\n\\r\\nFirst aid can be useful in many different situations, from sprains to electric shocks to heart attacks.\\r\\nFirst aid might involve a simple action, such as placing a person in the correct position to breathe freely. It might involve a more skilled activity, such as cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) if they have stopped breathing.\\r\\nThe provision of prompt and appropriate first aid can reduce the severity of an injury or illness and in extreme cases, could mean the difference between life and death.\\r\\nFirst aid refers to medical attention that is usually administered immediately after the injury occurs and at the location where it occurred. It often consists of a one-time, short-term treatment and requires little technology or training to administer. First aid can include cleaning minor cuts, scrapes, or scratches; treating a minor burn; applying bandages and dressings; the use of non-prescription medicine; draining blisters; removing debris from the eyes; massage; and drinking fluids to relieve heat stress.\\r\\nFirst aid can treat all sorts of minor bumps and scrapes, but you should see a doctor for more serious accidents. You may want to think about getting a first aid kit for your house or training in first aid so that you are prepared to deal with minor accidents.\\r\\nBasic first aid refers to the initial process of assessing and addressing the needs of someone who has been injured or is in physiological distress due to choking, a heart attack, allergic reactions, drugs or other medical emergencies. Basic first aid allows you to quickly determine a person's physical condition and the correct course of treatment. You should always seek professional medical help as soon as you are able, but following correct first aid procedures can be the difference between life and death. Follow our entire tutorial, or find specific advice by checking out the sections listed above.\\r\\nFirst aid is the emergency treatment that is given to an injured or sick person or animal, often by someone who does not have medical training. First aid refers to the immediate treatment of an individual(s) that is injured or ill. First aid is not a full medical treatment.\",\n",

It tracks & measures ALL nutrients important to your health in real-time. This complete, holistic view of your nutrition, combined with Fuelbetter's ground-breaking digital dietitian, empowers you to achieve your dietary, health, and performance goals, whatever they are:\\r\\n\\r\\n‚àô Lasting weight loss\\r\\n\\r\\n‚àô Faster exercise recovery & performance\\r\\n\\r\\n‚àô Pregnancy health\\r\\n\\r\\n‚àô Shifting to a plant-based diet without losing out on important nutrients\\r\\n\\r\\n‚àô Immune system support\\r\\n\\r\\n‚àô & more...\\r\\n\\r\\nFuelbetter‚Äôs team of software engineers, data scientists, RDs, and sports scientists have spent years developing the proprietary technology that makes the app possible. The end result is revolutionary: FOUR WORLD-FIRST functionalities which can help you take control of your health like never before.\\r\\n\\r\\n1. PRECISELY CALCULATE YOUR BIOLOGICAL REQUIREMENTS\\r\\nFuelbetter calculates your unique nutrient requirements using techniques normally reserved for elite athletes. The one-size-fits-all RDAs (recommended daily allowances) communicated by public health authorities are relevant to hardly any of us. Not only that, but requirements can shift suddenly during moments of life change, such as pregnancy, taking on a new physical challenge, starting a weight loss journey, or going vegan.\\r\\n\\r\\nIron is a great example: A woman following a paleo diet who exercises infrequently may have a dietary iron need of 4mg/day, while another woman of the same height and weight but following a vegan diet and training as an endurance runner may need 100mg/day. That‚Äôs a big difference ‚Äì equivalent to the amount of iron in 3.5kg (8 lbs) of spinach!\\r\\n\\r\\n2. TEST FOR 164 NUTRIENT DEFICIENCIES/EXCESSES\\r\\nFuelbetter monitors your nutrient intake throughout the day, compares this to your nutrient requirements, and checks for the presence of any nutritional deficiencies or excesses. Historically, only blood tests could offer this level of insight, at an average cost more than $15/¬£10 per nutrient. Fuelbetter tests for 164 nutrients in real time, at a fraction of the cost.\\r\\n\\r\\n3. ON-DEMAND DIGITIAL NUTRITIONIST\\r\\nOnce you‚Äôve identified any problem areas in your diet, Fuelbetter‚Äôs powerful digital nutritionist suggests exactly what to eat to hit your nutrient requirements. Rather than complicated new recipes and obscure ingredients, you‚Äôll see meal suggestions based on foods you‚Äôre already eating. If you don‚Äôt like the first suggestion, just swipe left and to get another suggestion instantly.\\r\\n\\r\\n4. SEE THE HEALTH & CLIMATE IMPACT OF YOUR CHOICES\\r\\nJust in case you need any further motivation, Fuelbetter measures the real time impact of your food choices on your immune health, the health of the planet, and your risk of developing type 2 diabetes and other diet-related non-communicable diseases.\\r\\n\\r\\nRead Fuelbetter's full Terms of Service and Privacy Policy:\\r\\n\\r\\nhttps://www.fuelbetter.co/terms\\r\\nhttps://www.fuelbetter.co/privacy\",\n",

For people with diabetes, healthy eating is not simply a matter of what one eats, but also when one eats. Discover delicious, healthy recipes that fit into a diabetic diet. People with diabetes can eat any food that they want, preferably a healthy diet with some carbohydrates, but they need to be more aware of the carbohydrate content of foods and avoid simple sugars like juices and sugar-sweetened beverages.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhether you‚Äôre trying to prevent or control diabetes, your nutritional needs are virtually the same as everyone else, so no special foods are necessary. But you do need to pay attention to some of your food choices, most notably the carbohydrates you eat. While following a heart-healthy diet can help with this, the most important thing you can do is to lose a little weight.\\r\\n\\r\\nLosing just 5% to 10% of your total weight can help you lower your blood sugar, blood pressure, and cholesterol levels. Losing weight and eating healthier can also have a profound effect on your mood, energy, and sense of well being. Even if you‚Äôve already developed diabetes, it‚Äôs not too late to make a positive change. By eating healthier, being more physically active, and losing weight, you can reduce your symptoms or even reverse diabetes. The bottom line is that you have more control over your health than you may think.\\r\\n\\r\\nNutrition and physical activity are important parts of a healthy lifestyle when you have diabetes. Along with other benefits, following a healthy meal plan and being active can help you keep your blood glucose level, also called blood sugar, in your target range. To manage your blood glucose, you need to balance what you eat and drink with physical activity and diabetes medicine if you take any.\\r\\n\\r\\n<b>DIABETIC RECIPES APP EXPERIENCE</b>\\r\\n\\r\\nThis is simple to navigate and also has multiple tutorials available on how to use the app.\\r\\nAs the recipe is a set of instructions for cooking, our app also provides nutritional information, servings, total time for preparation and recommendations so that nothing can go wrong when you‚Äôre cooking.\\r\\n\\r\\n<b>Theme Support</b>\\r\\n\\r\\nMake your diabetic recipes cooking experience more comfortable at night by enabling dark mode.\\r\\n\\r\\n<b>Smart shopping list for your diet control</b>\\r\\n\\r\\nAn organized shopping list allows the user to create ingredients list so you won‚Äôt miss any for the recipe.

You‚Äôll lose weight effectively and feel more active! <b>No diet and no yo-yo effect</b>.\\r\\n\\r\\nIS IT EFFECTIVE?\\r\\nIt‚Äôs proven that intermittent fasting leads to <b>fast weight loss</b>. During fasting, as your glycogen depletes, your body switches to ketosis, which is referred to as the body\\'s \"fat-burning\" mode. This is an effective way to burn fat.\\r\\n\\r\\nIS IT SAFE?\\r\\nYes. It‚Äôs the <b>most natural and safe</b> way to lose weight. Studies show that eating all the time makes your body unable to take a break from digesting, which can result in health problems, such as diabetes.

It guides you through your plan. No need to change your diet, you can easily stick to it.

Cells break down viruses, bacteria and damaged components.\\r\\n\\r\\nPrevent Diseases\\r\\nStudies show that fasting can prevent numerous diseases, such as heart diseases, diabetes and cancer.\\r\\n\\r\\nCell Repair and Regenerate\\r\\nCells remove unnecessary or dysfunctional components. Damaged cells will be replaced with stronger ones.\\r\\n\\r\\nAgainst Aging\\r\\nYour body initiates autophagy, a process of detoxification, repair and regeneration.

There is no cure for food allergies, so it is important to recognize and avoid any ingredient that may cause serious allergic reactions or adverse effect on health. The FDA imposed regulation on food manufacturers to include any major food allergens on food labels to help allergic consumers identify offending foods or ingredients. However, there are food products that may have undeclared allergens so consumers must read the ingredients list thoroughly. \\r\\nWith Alertrak, consumers can take the guesswork out of checking food labels and save time. The app allows consumers to pick their food preferences for ingredients they want to avoid. Have a medical condition such as diabetes? Choose diabetes as the medical condition and ingredients to avoid and Alertrak will help find the information that matters. Just simply scan the barcodes at the grocery store and the app will inform users if the ingredients on labels show a match with users‚Äô food preferences. For many consumers, it is not idealistic to avoid all processed food products. Alertrak is a great tool in promoting better health management for consumers.',\n",

              "   'Description': 'Intolerance Food Diary is a simple way for you to record, monitor and isolate your food intolerances, food sensitivities, and food allergies.\\r\\n\\r\\n***This app is no longer in active development. It is offered \"as is\", and most likely no further updates will be released.***\\r\\n\\r\\nThe heart of the app is a diary in which you can record all the individual food items that you eat for each meal of the day. In addition you can also record any symptoms you experience which may be caused by some of these food items. The exact time and date is recorded for each entry, to build up a comprehensive picture of your diet and symptoms on an hour by hour, day by day basis. Any other information you wish to record can be entered as \"Notes\" in to the diary.\\r\\n\\r\\nEntering the information is easy because the Intolerance Food Diary remembers every food item, symptom, or note that you enter into the diary, so the next time you come to type in that same information it appears ready to select in a drop down list. This makes filling in the diary much quicker and more reliable.\\r\\n\\r\\nOnce you have recorded a useful amount of data on your food consumption and symptoms, the app is able to perform a statistical analysis on this information and then give an indication of which food items might be the most likely cause of a specific symptom you are experiencing (the app disregards any notes you have entered). In addition you can look for foods which, after consumption, may have either a short or a long \"incubation period\" before causing a noticeable symptom. This can be done by adjusting a simple slider to influence how the statistical analysis looks at the data. It should be noted that the information provided in this app does not constitute medical advice. You should always consult with a medical professional before embarking on any course of action which may affect your health.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe app also allows you to create reports from the data in your food and symptom diary. You can select entries between any two dates, and export the data to a PDF report document or a CSV data file (for use in a spreadsheet). The information can then be emailed to either yourself or the medical professional who is monitoring your diet.\\r\\n\\r\\nPaying a small fee to upgrade to the premium version of the app removes all the banner adverts, and allows you access to the \"Backup/Restore Diary\" feature. This allows you to backup your entire diary database to a single file, move that file to a new device, and then restore the diary in full to that new device. You can also do the same with your Food Dictionary database which is built up from all the foods you enter into the app. This allows you to carry on using Intolerance Food Diary with a new device.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis app needs certain permissions in order to work correctly. \\r\\n-- In App Purchases : This is needed to allow users to upgrade to the premium version of the app. However the free version of the app is still fully functional. The only feature non-premium users will not have access to, is the backup/restore diary function - and this feature is only required if you wish to move your diary to a new device.\\r\\n-- Photos/Media/Files : Don\\'t worry, the app does not go near any media or files already on your device. The app needs this permission in order to create PDF and CSV reports of your food diary, and to save them on your device in a specific \"IntoleranceFoodDiary\" folder. The app then needs to be able to read these report files so you can attach them to an email. It also needs file system access for the backup/restore feature which saves the whole diary database to a single file located in the same specific folder.\\r\\n-- Network Access : The app needs network access to load the banner adverts which are displayed in the non-premium version of the app. No other data is received or transmitted by the app other than that required for the banner adverts.\\r\\n\\r\\nAll data entered into this app is stored locally on your device. It is only accessible by you.',\n",

With these steps, everyone can enjoy meals and stay safe from an allergic reaction.\\r\\n\\r\\nPlanning meals around food allergens, whether for you or your child, doesn‚Äôt have to be complicated and stressful. All it takes is certain kitchen organization tactics and some simple food swaps.\\r\\n\\r\\nAny food could provoke an allergic reaction, says Matthew Greenhawt, MD, an allergist at the University of Michigan Allergy Clinic and an assistant professor at the division of allergy and immunology with the University of Michigan Health Center in Ann Arbor. But he says eight foods account for 90 percent of food allergies: milk, eggs, fish, shellfish, tree nuts, peanuts, wheat, and soy.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt‚Äôs rare, but some people, especially children and young adults, can have a severe, life-threatening allergic reaction (anaphylaxis) if they come in contact with these foods. So you want to keep them not only out of dishes you prepare, but also away from ‚Äúsafe‚Äù foods to avoid cross-contamination.\\r\\n\\r\\nPacking a lunch Free-From the top food allergens is easy with Enjoy Life Foods.

Food allergies are relatively uncommon, affecting 6 ‚Äì 8% of children and up to 3% of adults, and they can have symptoms that range from mild to life-threatening.But by eliminating trigger foods and caring for your overall well-being, you can successfully deal with your food allergies.\\r\\nFood allergies can be minor or they can be a major health risk ‚Äî even deadly. They can cause hives, constipation, diarrhea, bloating, anaphylaxis (closing of throat), or rash.

Well done!\" - Bernhard Smuts\\r\\n‚Ä¢ \"This app is phenomenal. The design descions and features are all super intuitive and cater to weightlifting perfectly. One of my favourite things is the way the app handles adding exercises and sets. You can add sets from a preset workout or one by one, and adding custom exercises is a breeze. Every time you add an exercise it prepopulates the sets from your last exercise and there is a quick look button that shows how heavy you went last time you did the exercise. I cannot recommend it enough.\" - Sam Mete\\r\\n‚Ä¢ \"I was about to lose my mind trying to find an intuitive, straightforward app to track my workouts. I finally stopped the search with this app. It didn\\'t take long to add previous workouts, and it\\'s so convenient for logging new workouts as well.\" - Tara Gordon\\r\\n\\r\\n<b>Contact us</b>\\r\\nWe will be happy to hear your questions and feature suggestions on kotssl@yandex.ru',\n",

              "   'Description': \"Weight lifting isn't just for men. It's a myth that lifting weights will make women bulky or put them at risk of injury. Women can excel at weight lifting and experience major physical and mental benefits from strength training, including a leaner, more muscular body as well as better self-esteem.\\r\\n\\r\\nOur workout programs are designed to get you leaner and stronger with minimal cardio and a lot of picking up and putting down heavy stuff ‚Äì otherwise known as strength training. If you're looking to lose weight or just maintain your physique, try cutting back on cardio for a few weeks to focus on these strength training exercises for women that increase metabolism and build lean muscle.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe don‚Äôt mean bodyweight strength training. We mean building up to use dumbbells, a barbell, free weights, and kettlebells. That‚Äôs right, I‚Äôm talking about dominating that section of the gym. Strength training is one of the most rewarding skills one can master with just a few simple and extremely functional movements. \\r\\n\\r\\nLifting weights two to three times per week is extremely beneficial for women to reduce their risk of osteoporosis by promoting bone health. Between the ages of 30 and 70, muscle mass and strength decrease by an average of 30%, mostly due to inactivity. Weight training can prevent or even reverse this process and, in turn, provides the following benefits: improved performance of physical activities, prevention and management of chronic diseases, improved joint health, prevention and treatment of low-back pain, injury prevention, relief of aches and pains from stress or after prolonged sitting, improved posture, and improved quality of sleep.\\r\\n\\r\\n<b>How to Start Lifting Weights: A Beginner's Guide</b>\\r\\nWhether your goal is to build muscle mass or achieve a fitter, more toned body, weight training can help you get there. Weight training, also known as resistance or strength training, builds lean, stronger muscles, strengthens your bones and joints, and even helps boost your metabolism. This means you‚Äôll burn more calories even when you‚Äôre resting.\\r\\n\\r\\nStronger muscles can also improve your athletic performance and reduce your chance of injuries. Even if you‚Äôve never done any kind of weight training before, it‚Äôs never too late to start. Strength training is appropriate for both men and women, and it can be started at any age or fitness level.\\r\\n\\r\\nYou don‚Äôt need to be a fitness buff. In fact, you don‚Äôt even need to belong to a gym. You can simply use your body weight for many exercises or use free weights, dumbbells, barbell, resistance bands, or other home fitness equipment to get results.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis app will walk you through how to get started with weight training and provide suggested exercises and training advice (plus 30 day programs!) for beginners.\",\n",

The specially designed training system will get rid of muscle cramps and blocks. What makes this happen? In carrying out the sports activity, there is an increase in the local blood flow, especially in the muscles and ligaments, due to which the local metabolism and metabolic processes are enhanced.

To do this, we offer to regularly measure our indicators:\\r\\n1) The distance from the fingertips to the floor when tilted forward - characterizes the general condition of the spine and its health. Just do flexible stretches for men and women, even for runners and the results will come!\\r\\n2) The distance from the center of the palm to the level of the knee when tilting sideways from a standing position - here is the condition and elasticity of the back and waist when tilting.\\r\\n3) The distance to the floor from the position when the person sits on the splits - if the muscles of the legs are clamped and their elasticity is missing, then this is a very difficult task.\\r\\n\\r\\n‚≠ê The main task of this app is not only to do body flexibility training for beginners, men & women, for gymnastics, - but to create a stable habit of regular stretch exercises in the context of life.\",\n",

Muscles that are flexible help you stay physically and mentally fit and healthy.\\r\\n\\r\\n~Prevent Muscle Imbalance: When we stretch our tight muscles, they relax and their fibers repair, protecting our muscles from muscle imbalance problems.\\r\\n\\r\\n~Reduce the risk of injury: Stretching before exercise is recommended because it reduces joint and muscle tension and protects us from injuries by increasing muscle flexibility and range of motion.\\r\\n\\r\\n~Improving posture: Stretching also helps to keep the human body's posture in check. Stretching the chest, lower back, and shoulders on a regular basis is beneficial for proper back alignment and improves our posture.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n|##| WHAT FREE USERS WILL GET:\\r\\n\\r\\n~A free stretching workout routine every day.\\r\\n\\r\\n~Every joint moved methodically in every direction.\\r\\n\\r\\n~The ability to challenge friends or family to reach custom stretching goals.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n|##| PRO USERS WILL RECEIVE ALL OF OUR STRETCHING WORKOUT APP'S FEATURES:\\r\\n\\r\\n~Unlimited custom built routines.\\r\\n\\r\\n~Filtering by pose and body part.\\r\\n\\r\\n~Routines for Pain Relief.\\r\\n\\r\\n~Strengthening workouts.\\r\\n\\r\\n~Aerobic workouts.\\r\\n\\r\\n~Warm-up and cool-down routines for athletes.\\r\\n\\r\\n~Pregnancy specific routines.\\r\\n\\r\\n~Routines specific to the workplace.\\r\\n\\r\\n~Create group challenges.\\r\\n\\r\\n~The Alberta Tour\\r\\n\\r\\n~Access to Leaderboards\\r\\n\\r\\n~Access to Dashboard to track your stretching history.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nUnless auto-renew is turned off at least 24-hours before the end of the current period, the subscription automatically renews.

              "   'Description': \"Stretching can increase flexibility and improve your joints' range of motion, helping you move more freely. And ensuring that you have equal flexibility on both sides might help protect you from injury. Stretching can also reduce pain from chronic conditions, such as osteoarthritis and lower back pain.\\r\\nIt is a crucial part of a regular workout regimen because stretching after a workout routine relaxes tightened muscles. You can improve flexibility of specific muscles as well as the entire body with our simple exercises. \\r\\n\\r\\nIt may seem basic, but better mobility and incorporating mobility workouts into your routine may be the secret sauce for improving your overall health and fitness. Just as you train for aerobic endurance, strength and flexibility, you also need to train for mobility, especially if you want to maintain a vibrant, active life. \\r\\n\\r\\nFlexibility is integral to a healthy and mobile body. Flexible muscles allow you to perform better in your daily activities and reduce risk of injury. Bad posture is one of the best incentives to stretch. If you fix alignment your body will move better and feel better. Your workouts will become more effective because you will now easily access the correct muscles needed to optimize training. The app includes multiple 8-week stretch programs that will help you to drastically improve your flexibility. Flexibility isn‚Äôt a goal with a clear beginning and end ‚Äî it needs to be integrated into your routine every day. But for someone that doesn‚Äôt usually stretch and wanting to see improvement, a stretch workout per day is the sweet spot to see real change in eight weeks. \\r\\n\\r\\nHow To Do The Splits Without Hurting Yourself In Just A Few Weeks?\\r\\nOur stretching plan will get you there. Achieving the splits stretch means that someone has impressive flexibility in their hips, glutes, and hamstrings, and working towards the splits is a pinnacle flexibility goal for many fitness fanatics. Our app shows how you can go from barely bendy to doing perfect front and side splits in just 30 days. Use our stretching routine as a weekly guideline to help teach your body to do the splits. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe latest statistics show that improving flexibility is the most popular reason for starting yoga, and research does prove that it‚Äôs one of the biggest benefits of regular practice. However there are a number of asanas that can help to make you more flexible than the rest. We added our top 20 yoga poses for improving flexibility.\",\n",

As we age, our muscles get shorter and less elastic, she adds. \"We need to take an active role in maintaining and improving the length of our muscles so we can continue to enjoy our abilities without pain.\\r\\nStanding Hamstring Stretch.\\r\\nStand tall with your feet hip-width apart, knees slightly bent, arms by your sides.Exhale as you bend forward at the hips, lowering your head toward floor, while keeping your head, neck and shoulders relaxed.Wrap your arms around backs of your legs and hold anywhere from 45 seconds to two minutes.Bend your knees and roll up when you\\'re done.\\r\\nPiriformis Stretch\\r\\n\\r\\nThe piriformis muscle is a deep internal hip rotator, located on the outside of the butt. Its primary role is external rotation, Atkins says. \"Deep internal rotators, while small, produce a lot of the movement at the hip and are often overlooked.Since the piriformis crosses over the sciatic nerve, \"if it is tight, it can result in sciatic nerve irritation, Cyrelson says. Stretching this muscle can prevent potential future sciatica, or help treat it.\\r\\nLunge With Spinal Twist\\r\\n\\r\\nAtkins notes that this stretch is commonly referred to as the World\\'s Greatest Stretch (WGS) in the fitness community. And for good reason: \"It\\'s essential to help with posture-related pain or for people who sit for prolonged periods of time,\" says Dan Giordano, D.P.T., C.S.C.S., cofounder of Bespoke Treatments Physical Therapy in New York City and Seattle. \"It helps open your hips and improve thoracic (mid-back) mobility,\" he tells SELF.\\r\\nFigure Four Stretch\\r\\n\\r\\n\"This specifically stretches the piriformis and iliopsoas muscles (essentially your hip rotator and flexor muscles) and the IT band. Because of this and the passive nature of the pose, it is an excellent and gentle approach to helping relieve symptoms associated with sciatica and knee pain,\" John Murray, yoga instructor and co-founder of Lyons Den Power Yoga, tells SELF.\\r\\n90/90 Stretch\\r\\n\\r\\nThis modification of pigeon pose helps with internal rotation of one leg and external rotation of the other, \"so you\\'re hitting both movements of the hip at once,\" Atkins says. It\\'s a good option for people who have extremely tight hip flexors, she adds. \"The front thigh is safely on the ground in a position that doesn\\'t cause too much stress.\"\\r\\nFrog Stretch\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Most of us sit and cross our legs, which can lead to tight hips and result in lower-back pain,\" Lacee Lazoff, a NASM-certified personal trainer and instructor at the Fhitting Room in New York City, tells SELF. \"This stretch directly target tights spots in the hips/groin and is especially useful for runners.\"',\n",

Incorporating some stretching exercises into your workout schedule will help you improve flexibility, reduce tightness, and ultimately, make your workouts more efficient and safe. Stretching is important, yet often most neglected part of the fitness. Not only while working out, but you should also include stretching and flexibility exercises into your daily routine. Avoiding stretching may result in increased soreness and fatigue. \\r\\n\\r\\nA full-body stretching routine can help you unfold and improve body alignment. Stretching a muscle temporarily relaxes it and allows it to lengthen. Common logic dictates that a good stretching routine paired with an appropriate warm up and cool down before and after activity and can be an effective way to prevent injuries. For a full body routine from head to toe, roll out a yoga mat and try these stretches.\\r\\n\\r\\n<b>How to Become More Flexible - Best Stretches for Flexibility</b>\\r\\nWe've listed the best stretches to alleviate pain and increase your flexibility and range of motion. These stretches will also help avoid injury during cardio or strength workouts. Gently lean into each position and observe which ones feel particularly challenging.  Flexibility plays a more important role in our well-being than we may realize. Experts believe that good flexibility helps you to achieve better results in your training, increases mobility and muscle coordination, reduces muscle pain, and prevents injuries.\\r\\n\\r\\nStretching may help you:\\r\\n- Improve your joint range of motion\\r\\n- Improve your athletic performance\\r\\n- Decrease your risk of injury\\r\\n\\r\\n<b>The Daily Stretching Routine</b>\\r\\nWe added the best stretches for beginners for warm-up, cooldown, and everyday flexibility. Flexibility is related to muscle tension and length, and it‚Äôs a component of mobility, which is the degree to which you can move a joint through its full range of motion. By incorporating a stretching program into your daily routine, you can increase your flexibility and range of motion. You can also improve performance in sports and daily tasks. Stretching can help prevent injury and decrease pain associated with muscle tightness.\",\n",

For example, improved flexibility helps the body perform everyday tasks more efficiently and reduces the chance of injury. \\r\\n\\r\\nIf you exercise regularly, stretching should be a part of your exercise routine, but regardless of your exercise routine, everyone should make time to practice stretching on a daily basis. \\r\\n\\r\\n<b> App Flexibility Stretch Exercise features: </b>\\r\\n‚Ä¢ More than 80 stretches for flexibility\\r\\n‚Ä¢ More than 300 stretching routines for women\\r\\n‚Ä¢ Create your own routines\\r\\n‚Ä¢ Stretching Exercise at Home\\r\\n‚Ä¢ Stretching plan 30 days\\r\\n\\r\\n<b>Here are some of the benefits of stretching <b>\\r\\n<b> Reduced tension in the muscles<b>\\r\\n\\r\\nStretching helps your muscles relax, which allows oxygen and nutrients to move more easily through your body. \\r\\n\\r\\n<b> Relieves pain after exercise<b>\\r\\nStretching your muscles after exercise helps keep them loose and lessens the soreness that can occur after a hard workout. \\r\\n\\r\\n<b> Improve posture<b>\\r\\nMuscle imbalances can cause us to slouch. When you regularly stretch the muscles in your shoulders, chest, and lower back, you help your back muscles to be better aligned. Better posture will help you stand more upright and make you feel taller\\r\\n\\r\\n<b> Improves circulation<b>\\r\\nWhen you stretch, you increase blood flow to your joints and muscles. This helps nutrients move more easily and improves circulation throughout the body. \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<b> reduce stress<b>\\r\\nWhen you stretch and release tension, your body will feel more relaxed. If you find yourself holding tension in one part of your body, like your neck, be sure to pay more attention to it. Try stretching as part of your bedtime routine, this will help you relax and prepare for sleep.\\r\\n\\r\\n<b> Stretching exercises provide<b>\\r\\n- Pre-Workout Warm Up\\r\\n- Post-Workout Cool Down\\r\\n- Morning Warmup\\r\\n- Sleepy Time Stretching\\r\\n- Pre-Run Warm Up\\r\\n- Post-Run Cool Down\\r\\n- Pre-Playing Football Warm Up\\r\\n- Post-Playing Football Cool Down\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd finally, remember to relax.
